The installation help provides additional, up-to-date and detailed information on installing Allplan for the first time and upgrading Allplan on stand-alone workstations and on networks.  This help is also available online (http://help.allplan.com/Allplan/2020-0/1033/Allplan/152880.htm). • The Allplan 2020 DVD includes the install.chm help file, which you can find in the programs\\\\x64\\\\Allplan\\\\HelpFiles\\\\English\\\\ folder. 8 Read the following before installing Allplan 2020  System requirements for Allplan 2020 Before you begin, make sure all the computers where you want to install Allplan 2020 meet the minimum requirements. Hardware requirements Minimum requirements  • Intel processor or compatible • 4 GB of RAM • 10 GB of available hard-drive space • OpenGL 4.2-compatible graphics card with 2 GB of RAM and a resolution of 1280 x 1024 Recommended  • Intel Core i9, i7 or i5 processor or compatible • 16 GB of RAM • Display resolution of up to 2560 x 1600 (for 4K resolutions and higher resolutions, you can use the scaling options provided by the operating system (Windows 8.1 or later); if you work with several monitors, make sure they all have the same resolution.) • OpenGL 4.2-compatible graphics card with 8 GB of RAM; use a certified graphics card: www.allplan.com/info/graphiccards Tip: You can download a system test from connect.allplan.com/support/sysinfo/2020.html. By running this system test, you can check whether your computer meets the system requirements for Allplan 2020. Installation, Basics Installation 9  Supported operating systems Supported operating systems:  • Windows 10 64-bit, version 1809* • Windows 8.1 64-bit • Windows 7 64-bit, Service Pack 1 (not recommended) • Windows Server 2019, Standard Edition (for Citrix) • Windows Server 2016, Standard Edition (for Citrix) Supported data servers:  • Windows Server 2019 • Windows Server 2016 • Windows Storage Server 2016 for NAS Notes  • Recommended operating system : Windows 10 64-bit, version 1809* • Recommended data server : Windows Server 2019  • * LTSB/LTSC version excluded  Further information connect.allplan.com/support/sysinfo/2020.html • provides further information, such as the system test tool. 10 Read the following before installing Allplan 2020  Some notes on the data structure Allplan data can be classified as follows:  • Program folder : Program files are always installed locally on every workstation. Normally, you can accept the folder proposed by the program. • Central file storag e folder : Projects and the office standard are saved to this folder. If the workgroup option  is installed, the folder also contains the data for network administration in the \\\\Net folder. The central file storage folder can be installed locally or on a file server. When you install the program with the workgroup option , the folder you specify here acts as the central file storage folder of the workgroup. Please read the notes on the central file storage folder with network installations. • Local file storage folder : This folder is used to synchronize the data of the central file storage folder and the data of online projects. If you do not specify a local file storage folder, the program synchronizes the data of online projects with the LocalData subfolder of the central file storage folder. You must specify a local file storage folder on the local computer if you want to access Allplan online projects from a mobile computer (for example, when you work from home or as a freelancer). You do not need to do this if you use a stationary computer that can always access the central file storage folder. Prior to installing, decide on the folders where you want to install the program. If you need to change this later, you usually have to uninstall the program and then re-install it again. It is a good idea to keep the data files and program files in two separate, central locations. This will facilitate backup operations later.  By default, Allplan 2020 is installed to the following folders:  • Program files : C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Allplan\\\\ • Central file storage : C:\\\\Data\\\\Allplan\\\\ • Local file storage : C:\\\\Local Data\\\\Allplan\\\\ Installation, Basics Installation 11  Installing First-time installation on a stand-alone workstation This section shows how to install Allplan 2020 on a stand-alone workstation.

Installation, Basics Allplan\\'s user interface 49  Objects palette The Objects  palette lists all objects in the currently open drawing files (current  or open in edit mode  or open in reference mode ). You can sort these objects according to certain criteria. It is possible to show or hide selected objects and to define their transparency. You can also activate or deactivate objects in the Objects  palette. The Objects  palette has the following areas: “Sort criterion” buttons    Custom or   Predefined Click this button to change the sort sequence. You can choose from different categories for each sorting criterion. After you have selected custom sorting by clicking  Custom , you can use a shortcut menu (see \"Shortcut menu - custom sorting\" on page 53) to turn on or off sorting criteria and several categories. In addition, you can save custom sorting (  Save sorting favorites ) and load a sorting favorite (  Load sorting favorites ). The   Predefined  setting provides the following six sorting criteria:  Sort by building structure This criterion combines all objects in the currently open drawing files into groups, listing the groups alphabetically. You can find the objects at the lowest level in each group. The details from the building structure are at the top level in the hierarchy.  Sort by drawing file The drawing files containing the objects are at the top level in the hierarchy. 50 Palettes Allplan 2020   Sort by layer The layers are at the top level in the hierarchy. If an object (for example, a window opening) consists of several elements (for example, sill and window SmartPart) that are assigned to different layers, you can find this object in the *varied*  list.  Sort by material The materials assigned to the objects are at the top level in the hierarchy. If an object does not have a material attribute , you can find this object in the *not defined*  list.  Sort by trade The trades assigned to the objects are at the top level in the hierarchy. If an object does not have a trade  attribute, you can find this object in the *not defined*  list.  Sort by attribute The attributes assigned to the objects are at the top level in the hierarchy. Open the shortcut menu (see \"Shortcut menu - custom sorting\" on page 53) of custom sorting to use a second, freely definable attribute for sorting. If an object does not have an attribute , you can find this object in the *not defined*  list. “Control” buttons   Expand selected entries  Expands the view so that you can see all subentries of the selected node.

When you point to the symbol, you can define the transparency setting.  indicates that this hierarchical level includes both objects with transparency and objects without transparency.  indicates that all objects of this hierarchical level have transparency settings of 100%, which means that these objects are not visible in animation . When you point to objects that cannot be made transparent (for example, 2D objects), you can see the following note: Transparency not available for these objects. Note : Some 3D objects (for example, SmartParts for opening elements) cannot be made transparent for the time being. When you make a component (for example, a wall) transparent and this component contains such objects, Allplan hides these objects (for example, SmartParts for opening elements). As soon as you turn transparency off, all objects are visible again. Visibility :   /   = visible / invisible  indicates that this hierarchical level includes both visible objects and invisible objects.  indicates that the layer of this object or object group is hidden or that this object is not selected in \"Show/Hide\". Selection :   /   = active / inactive  indicates that this hierarchical level includes both active objects and inactive objects.

At least one entry remains selected on the shortcut menu. Note : You can save custom sorting (  Save favorites for sorting ) and load a sorting favorite (  Load favorites for sorting ).   Planes palette The Planes  palette displays the plane models of the current building structure; each plane model gets its own tab. While creating components, you can keep track of the default planes and all other objects on which the heights of the components can be based. In the Planes  palette, you can create new plane models, modify plane models and insert or replace roofscapes. These tasks are similar to those provided by the   Floor Manager  dialog box of the building 54 Palettes Allplan 2020  structure. But if you want to insert reference surfaces  and offset planes in a plane model, you must use the palette. When   Modification m ode is on, the planes of the plane model are visible in all viewports. When you point to or select an entry of the plane model in the tree structure, this entry is highlighted in the detection color in all viewports. So, you can immediately check the position of the plane and see the effects of changes. The Planes  palette has the following areas: Toolbar   Expand all entries of act ive model  Expands the tree structure so that all subordinate entries of the active plane model are visible.  Collapse all entries  Hides all subentries.  Update model  Updates the plane model in the palette so that the plane model is up to date.    Modification mode on /off  Activates modification mode and opens the palette for entries. When modification mode is on, the planes of the plane models are visible in all viewports. When you point to or select an entry of the plane model in the tree structure, this entry is highlighted in the detection color in all viewports. You can also find this tool on the shortcut menu.  New model  Opens the New model  palette, where you can create a new plane model.

You can also find this tool on the shortcut menu.  Insert pair of planes  Inserts a pair of planes as the top story in the current plane model. Allplan takes the offset values from the top pair of planes, incrementing the story name by one. You can change the heights and names in the palette. You can also find this tool on the shortcut menu. Note:  By using the Insert Pair of Planes  dialog box of   Floor Manager  in the building structure, you can also take the default planes from a drawing file or an NDW file.  Insert offset plane  Inserts an offset plane in the plane model. The offset plane is linked with a default plane at an offset you define. When you change the linked plane, the offset plane adapts automatically, including all elements that are attached to this offset plane. When defining the offset plane, you can select the Applies to all floors  option to apply this offset plane to all stories of the plane model. When an offset plane applies to all stories, you can see the   symbol in floor manager.  Insert or replace roofscape  Inserts a roofscape in the pair of planes selected or replaces the roofscape selected. Use the Input Options  to specify how you want to insert the roofscape in the current plane model (compared with the source): • Do not change roofscape (compared with source). • The bottom level of the roofscape is equivalent to the bottom of the story; top levels do not change. • The roofscape as a whole is moved to the height of the bottom of the story. Select a roof plane or a custom plane in an active drawing file. Replacing a roofscape does not change the reference to all drawing 56 Palettes Allplan 2020  files that use this roofscape. You can also find this tool on the shortcut menu of a story node.  Insert or replace reference surface  Inserts a local reference surface in the plane model or replaces the reference surface selected. The height of the reference surface is defined by the z-value of the lowest point in the reference surface. You can also find this tool on the shortcut menu of a story node. Use the symbol between height and name to specify how you want to connect the reference surface with the upper or lower plane of the structural level to which you have added the reference surface. Click the symbol to switch between the following settings:  Do not connect  (default setting)   Connect with bottom level    Connect with top level  Note: By selecting Extract reference surface  on the shortcut menu of a reference surface, you extract the reference surface from the plane model and insert the reference surface in the current drawing file.

Activating tools • You can click the relevant icon. • You can double-click the element with the right mouse button. This activates the tool that was used to create the element, adopting all settings and parameters of the element you clicked. • You can select tools by using keyboard shortcuts. To get a list of all predefined shortcuts, click Shortcut Keys  in the   Help  drop-down list (right side of the title bar). In addition, the keyboard shortcut for tools where one has been defined is shown in the ToolTip. • You can use the shortcut menu. • You can activate tools on the menu bar. Running tools After you have clicked a tool, you can find instructions in the dialog line. For example: • Point snap  (for example,   Line  tool: From point) • Selecting  elements (for example,   Delete  tool: Select elements you want to delete). When appropriate, you can see a dialog box or context toolbar so that you can make settings for the tool. Closing tools • Select the Esc key on the keyboard. • Right -click the Actionbar or a toolbar. • Activate a different tool. Installation, Basics Basic approach 97  Correcting errors When you make an error in Allplan, you can use   Undo  (Quick Access Toolbar ) to correct the error. The number of undo steps is unlimited. For example, if you inadvertently moved an element, you can annul the move. You can go back (undo) as many steps as you want, as far back as the last time the data was saved. Note that certain actions, such as switching between drawing files or switching to Layout Editor , make Allplan save the data automatically. You can undo several steps in one go. Click the arrow beside the Undo icon and drag the cursor over all the steps you want to undo. Then release the mouse button.   Redo  redoes operations that you have undone. Redo operations, however, are not possible if you have added new design entities in the meantime. Note : You can also activate   Undo  while another tool is active. The tool in question will close and all the entries you made while it was active are undone.  Tip: If you inadvertently deleted elements, you can quickly restore them by immediately right-clicking in the workspace twice (the Delete  tool must still be active). 98 Saving your work Allplan 2020  Saving your work When you exit Allplan, all open drawing files will be saved automatically. You do not need to save your data explicitly (as in other programs) before you exit Allplan. Exception: NDW files must be saved manually. In certain circumstances, Allplan makes backup copies of your drawing files or layouts. For more information, see Using .bak files (on page 99). While you are working in Allplan, you can save your data manually or you can have the program do so automatically after a certain number of steps. This applies to the data in the current drawing file and in drawing files that are open in edit mode. Some actions (for example, switching to Layout Editor ) also make Allplan save the data automatically. Allplan saves the data when you  • Switch to a different drawing file, fileset, layout or project. • Switch to Layout Editor . •   Export ing data from Allplan • Save manually with   Save  (Quick Access Toolbar  or CTRL+S) or   Save and Compress  (Allplan  icon on the title bar). • Save automatically. You can activate this tool and define the number of steps between saves in the   Options  on the Desktop environment  page. Allplan will not save the data until you close the current tool. Installation, Basics Basic approach 99  Allplan does not compress the data saved automatically or manually with   Save . In other words, the document size will not be smaller although you have deleted data. The reason for this is that the data you have deleted is still in the memory so that you can restore the data even after saving. Use   Save and Compress  to compress the data when you save manually. All the other actions that save data also compress the data.  Using .bak files Specific actions cause Allplan to make backup copies (files ending in .bak) of the drawing file or layout. The .bak files and the original drawing files and layouts are stored in the same folder; that is, the project folder. You can choose to create .bak files in the   Options  on the Desktop environment  page. If you have selected the wrong tool, you can use the .bak file to restore the original data of a drawing file or layout. All you need to do is rename the drawing file or layout in File Explorer. Allplan creates . bak files  • When you select the   Copy, Move Elements between Documents  tool. • When you delete drawing files and layouts by using   Delete Document... . • When you delete the contents of drawing files and layouts in the Open on a project -specific basis: drawing files from fileset/building structure  or layouts  dialog box. • Before you import data to drawing files by using   Import  • Before you import data by using Add drawing files and layouts with resources to project .  Note : Note that these backup copies can increase the volume of data involved in backing up projects. Therefore, delete unnecessary .bak files before you start the backup. 100 Saving your work Allplan 2020  To use .bak files  For example: You have accidentally copied wrong elements to drawing file 4711.  1 Find out which folder contains the current project: Start the Services application, select the Service  menu, choose Hotline Tools  and double-click wopro . 2 Exit the Allplan project. 3 Delete or rename the file tb004711.ndw. You can name it tb004711.ndw.old, for example. 4 Rename the file tb004711.ndw.bak. Enter tb004711.ndw for the new name.  For example: You have accidentally copied wrong eleme nts to layout 815.  1 Find out which folder contains the current project: Start the Services application, select the Service  menu, choose Hotline Tools  and double-click wopro . 2 Exit the Allplan project. 3 Delete or rename the pb000815.npl file (for example, pb000815.000.old). 4 Change the name of the pb000815.000.bak file to pb000815.npl. Installation, Basics Basic approach 101  Using the clipboard In Allplan you can copy elements to the clipboard and insert them in any drawing file or application. The input options provide numerous tools that help you place elements. Note : You cannot use the clipboard when you define patterns and fonts. Allplan features You can use the clipboard in Allplan just as you would in any other Windows application. Note, however, that there are some special elements and properties: • Layer : Elements retain their layers. Elements on frozen layers (visible and hidden) will not be copied. • Default planes : You must use Ctrl+A to select default planes. See also \"Behavior of default planes when copying or moving elements between documents\" in the Allplan Help. • Group number : Elements get new group numbers when you place them. Elements that had the same group numbers still have the same group numbers. • Document size : The program displays an error message if the file size is too large after you have inserted elements. • Texts : If the application from which you have copied texts to the clipboard is an OLE server (such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel), the contents of the clipboard will be pasted as an OLE object into Allplan. To paste the contents of the clipboard as normal text, use Paste Contents – Unformatted (Unicode) Text . Text of this kind gets the current text parameters. • FEA and Allfa elements : FEA and Allfa elements cannot be copied to the clipboard. 102 Using the clipboard Allplan 2020   Copy Use this tool to copy selected elements to the clipboard. You can then paste these elements from the clipboard as often as you need. To do this, use Paste  and Paste to  Original Position . The elements can also be pasted into other applications. This command is not available when no element is selected.  Cut Use this tool to delete selected elements and move them to the clipboard. You can then paste these elements from the clipboard as often as you need. To do this, use Paste  and Paste to Original Position . The elements can also be pasted into other applications. This command is not available when no element is selected.  Paste You can paste Allplan elements, text (for example, from a word-processing program) and bitmaps from the clipboard into Allplan. This tool is only available in plan view. This command is not available if the clipboard is empty or contains elements that cannot be pasted into Allplan. If the application from which you have copied text to the clipboard is an OLE server (such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel), the contents of the clipboard will be pasted as an OLE object into Allplan. Use Paste Contents  to paste the contents of the clipboard as normal text. Note : Allplan elements can only be pasted from the clipboard into the same type of document from which they were copied to the clipboard. The contents of the clipboard will always be pasted into the active document even if the data was copied from a file open in edit mode. Installation, Basics Basic approach 103  Pasting elements from the clipboard into Allplan The input options provide a number of tools that help you place elements. Allplan elements are inserted as original data (in other words, with attributes and properties). In the case of text, the current text parameters apply. You can also use the clipboard to insert bitmaps. The following settings are used: • Color depth: several colors • Transparency: off; color: black. • Width: 100 pixels = 1000mm The clipboard supports the following bitmap formats: DIB (or BMP) and WMF. Note : When the clipboard contains several formats supported by Allplan, you can use the Paste Contents  tool to select a format. Pasting Allplan elements into other applications When you paste Allplan elements into another application by using Ctrl+V, the elements are inserted as Windows Enhanced Metafile. But when the clipboard contains text elements (for example, normal text lines, paragraph text, component numbers, labels), these elements will always be pasted as ”pure” text into other applications.  Paste to Original Position You can use Paste to Original Position  to insert Allplan elements in their original position. This command is not available if the clipboard is empty or does not contain any Allplan elements. Note : If you insert these elements in the same document, they exist twice in the same position. Paste Contents You can use this tool to specify the contents of the clipboard you want to insert into Allplan. You can use this tool when the clipboard contains several formats supported by Allplan (for example, bitmap and pure text). 104  Allplan 2020 Installation, Basics Controlling what’s on your screen 105  Controlling what’s on your screen Allplan offers various tools you can use to control how your model and its design elements appear on the screen. Thus, you can always choose the tool best suited to the task at hand. You can access these tools from various places in Allplan. For example, you can use the  View  and   Window  (see \"Tools for arranging viewports \" on page 71) drop-down lists on the Quick Access Toolbar  (on page 21). You can also use the shortcut menu (see \"Shortcut menu in navigation mode\" on page 80) or the viewport toolbar (on page 69). You can even use the keyboard and mouse to control what\\'s on your screen. 106 Design mode and navigation mode Allplan 2020  Design mode and navigation mode Depending on whether you are designing or you want to get an impression of the model, you can use two different modes for controlling the display of your model on the screen: design mode  and navigation mode . Each mode has its specific properties: • In design mode , you can find the most important tools for drafting and designing directly on the shortcut menu (see \"Shortcut menu in design mode\" on page 78). You must select this mode if you want to identify points and design entities. In design mode, you usually use the mouse for drafting and designing  You are working in design mode  as long as   navigation mode  is not active. • Navigation mode , on the other hand, focuses on motion. In other words, the model itself moves or the observer moves around the model, viewing it. Here, you use the mouse and the tools on the shortcut menu (see \"Shortcut menu in navigation mode\" on page 80) to move around the 3D model and to visualize it. Therefore, you cannot click or select individual design entities in navigation mode.  You are working in navigation mode  as soon as you select the  Navigation Mode  tool in a viewport. If you want to identify a point or an entire element, switch to design mode  by deactivating navigation mode. As you can select the mode separately for each viewport, you can quickly and easily switch from one viewport in design mode to another viewport in navigation mode and check your design there. Installation, Basics Controlling what’s on your screen 107  View, perspective and scale In each viewport, you can zoom in on any section as close as you want (= enlarging the section). In addition, you can display the entire design with just one click, pan or move around your model in three dimensions. The easiest way to do this is to use the mouse and the tools on the viewport toolbar (on page 69). Of course, you can also use the tools on the menus or keyboard shortcuts. Allplan saves the individual perspective views and scales so that you can undo and redo your steps.  Controlling the view by using the mouse You can use the mouse to control the parameters defining the view of your model. These parameters include the (perspective) view, viewing angle, viewing direction, display scale and many more. Whether you want to zoom in, pan or change the viewing angle - you can achieve all these tasks just with the mouse. The mouse buttons have different functions depending on whether you work in design mode (see \"Design mode and navigation mode\" on page 106) or navigation mode (see \"Design mode and navigation mode\" on page 106).  Controlling the view by using the keyboard You can use the mouse to view or move through your model. In addition, you can use various keyboard shortcuts to move around step by step or to control camera positions you have already defined If you work in navigation mode (see \"Design mode and navigation mode\" on page 106), you can also use the shortcut menu to access the bold keyboard shortcuts. 108 View, perspective and scale Allplan 2020  Overview of keyboard shortcuts Keyboard shortcut  Tool  F2  Render F4  Opens a new viewport of the Animation  view type F5, double-click with middle mouse button Zoom All Shift+F5 Zoom All in All Viewports F6, Ctrl+middle mouse button Zoom Section Alt+Left arrow Takes you back to the previous view Alt+Right arrow Takes you to the next view Shift+Ctrl+S Save Contents of Viewport as a Bitmap Left arrow, Right arrow, Up arrow, Down arrow Rotates the view about the target point Backspace Takes you back to the previous view Shift+Backspace Takes you to the next view Ctrl Switches camera movement  from sphere mode  to camera mode  (while the key is pressed in) Ctrl++ (on the numeric keypad) Enlarge View Ctrl+- (on the numeric keypad) Reduce View Ctrl+F4 Closes the active viewport (animation viewport and design viewport) Ctrl+F6 Ctrl+Tab Switches between the active viewport and viewports in the background (for example, between animation viewport and viewport in which you are drawing) Double-click element in animation viewport Opens the Properties  dialog box of the element.

Installation, Basics Controlling what’s on your screen 109  View types for displaying models You can select the view type separately for each viewport. You can use different rendering methods (Wireframe , Hidden , Shaded , Sketch  or RT_Render ) to display your model in many ways. When Layout Editor  is open, you can switch between Design view  and Print view  (= preview of resulting printout).   Selecting and displaying elements In addition to the options described, you can control how design elements look on the screen. For example, you can hide groups of elements to speed up your computer or use a specific pen color or line thickness for all elements. As opposed to some of the other options, these settings always apply to all viewports.   Rules defining how elements look on the screen Elements do not always appear on the screen with the format properties you have defined. In other words, an element to which you have assigned the color red does not necessarily appear in red. The way elements look on the screen depends on several settings controlled by priorities. Top priority is given to several general settings in the   Options  (Desktop environment  page - General  area) for example, followed by the actual format properties of the elements. The following table shows the sequence in which elements appear on the screen. The Number  column shows the priority; the lower the number, the higher the priority of the corresponding setting. If, for example, you have selected the Use same color for  elements in reference files  option (priority 1), Allplan always uses the color 110 Rules defining how elements look on the screen Allplan 2020  selected for elements in reference files, regardless of all the other settings such as format properties, construction lines, color stands for pen option and so on.

The following table shows the sequence in which elements appear on the screen. The Number  column shows the priority; the lower the number, the higher the priority of the corresponding setting. For example, elements in drawing files open in reference mode are always behind elements in the current document or in files open in edit mode, regardless of other settings.   No. Setting  Explanation  1 Document status Elements in the current document or in documents open in edit mode always appear in front of elements in reference drawing files. 2 Show/Hide  - Surface elements in background  option When this option is selected, surface elements (hatching, pattern, fill) are placed behind other elements. 3 Sequence  element property See Sequence property (see \"\\'Sequence\\' property\" on page 111) 4 Time of creation/modification Elements that were created or modified later are placed in front of other elements. Note : For more information on the sequence in the layout, see “Sequence in which elements print (on page 290)” 112 Display sequence of elements Allplan 2020  Sequence property By default, elements are displayed in the sequence in which they were created or modified. This way, the element you created or modified last is always on top. Allplan provides several settings for changing the sequence so that you can prevent fills from hiding all the elements below, for example.  The Sequence  property is saved as a number between -15 and +16. The elements are displayed on screen in accordance with the value set: The greater the value, the further up the element. In other words, the element with the greatest value is on top of all the other elements. When two elements have the same value, the element you created last is displayed on top of the other one. New elements get a fixed default value, which depends on the element type. More information can be found in the Allplan help; see \"Values for the display sequence (see \"Values defining the display sequence\" on page 113)\". Note : New elements or modified elements are always on top. Only when you click   Refresh  will Allplan rearrange the elements in accordance with the sequence defined. In the case of elements consisting of subordinate elements (e.g. smart symbols, element groups, XRefs), the setting of the superordinate element has priority over the setting of subordinate elements. If, for example, you define that an element group is to be displayed on top of another element group, all the elements of which this element group consists are displayed on top of the elements of the other element group, regardless of the settings defined for subordinate elements. Installation, Basics Controlling what’s on your screen 113  Values defining the display sequence The following table displays the sequence  defaults for various elements created in Allplan. You can modify these values in the   Options  on the Desktop environment  page. The following table shows the defaults for creating elements. Element  Default value  Design entities   Normal design entities (lines, circles, ...) 0 Dimension lines, texts without fills +10 Dimension lines, texts with fills +14 OLE objects +11 XRefs 0 Fills -7 Bitmap areas, bitmaps -5 Style areas -4 Hatching, patterns -3 Architectural elements, bar reinforcement   Lines of architectural components Note:  So that the layers of multilayer walls do not overlap, the lines of every other, even wall layer automatically get the value +8. +7 Surface elements of architectural components Note:  You cannot enter a value for surface elements. The program automatically uses the value of the associated line minus 1. The surface elements of every other, even wall layer automatically get the value +7. +6 Lines of rooms, stories, areas -1 Surface elements of rooms, stories, areas -8 Bar reinforcement +9 114 Display sequence of elements Allplan 2020  Notes : • Converting a surface element to different one with   Convert Surface Element  does not change the display priority. • Elements in reference drawing files are always behind the elements in active drawing files. • If Surface elements in background  is selected in   Show/Hide , fills are always behind other elements, regardless of the priority.  Modifying the “sequence” property You have two options to modify the display sequence of elements: • Select   Modify Format Properties  (Actionbar  - Change  area or Format Properties  on the shortcut menu of an element) and enter a value between  -15 and +16. • Right-click an element, choose Sequence  on the shortcut menu and select the required tool:  This  Does this...   Bring to front  Moves the element to the top. This element is assigned a priority value of +16.  Send to back  Moves the element to the bottom. This element is assigned a priority value of -15.  One level to the front  Moves the element up one level. The priority value of this element is increased by a factor of 1.  One level to the back  Moves the element down one level. The priority value of this element is reduced by a factor of 1.  In front of another element  Moves the element in front of another element. Compared with the selected element, the priority value of the modified element is increased by a factor of 1.  Behind another element  Moves the element behind another element. Compared with the selected element, the priority value of the modified element is reduced by a factor of 1. Installation, Basics Using format properties 115  Using format properties Basics Defining an element’s pen thickness, line type and line color The Properties  palette opens as soon as you select a tool for creating elements. Before you draw the element, you define its line thickness (pen thickness) and line type in the Properties  palette. When Color stands for pen is on (it is off by default), Allplan automatically selects the color with the pen. If you work with layers and you take the format properties from the layer, Allplan automatically selects the format properties in accordance with the current layer. 116 Basics Allplan 2020  Modifying format properties Use   Modify Format Properties  (Actionbar - Change  task area) to modify the pen thickness, line type and line color of an element. After selecting the tool, you can see a dialog box, where you can define which format properties you want to change. Click   to match the format properties of an existing element. Note : To change the format properties of a single element, you can also use the shortcut menu. Just click Forma t Properties .  Using pen thickness Allplan provides 15 pens of different thickness, which you can select by clicking a number between 1 and 15. To specify which number represents which pen thickness, select Defaults  and choose Pen Thickness + Format QuickSelect . An element you are drawing either gets the current pen thickness or it takes the pen thickness from the current layer. For more information, see Defining format properties based on layers (on page 121). If the Color stands for pen  option is turned on, each pen thickness is represented by a specific color on the screen and in printouts. You can also use Defaults  - Pen Thickness + Format QuickSelect  to specify which color represents which pen thickness. The different thickness settings are usually not visible on the screen. If you want to display the thickness, select the Thick line  option in   Show/Hide . When printing, you can assign a thickness to each of Allplan\\'s 15 pens in the Pen and Color Assignment  dialog box (Print Layouts  tool, Print profile  tab, Pen and color assignments... ). Note : There are some particular issues to bear in mind when you assign pen thickness and line color to text and dimension text.  in the Pen thickness and line color of text and Pen thickness, line type and line color of dimension lines and text sections in the Allplan Help. Installation, Basics Using format properties 117  Using line types A line type is a repetitive combination of line sections and empty spaces in between. Allplan provides 15 different line types, which can be addressed by their number. By using Defaults  - Pen Thickness + Format QuickSelect , you can modify the definition of the individual line types. Line type 1 cannot be changed; it is always defined as a continuous line. An element you are drawing either gets the current line type or it takes the line type from the current layer. For more information, see Defining format properties based on layers (on page 121).  Using colors Allplan provides 256 colors. An element you are drawing either gets the current color or it takes the color from the current layer. For more information, see Defining format properties using layers (see \"Defining format properties based on layers\" on page 121).  When the Color stands for pen  option is switched on, the color of elements is defined by their pen thickness. Thus, the color displayed on screen is not the color of the element but the color assigned to the respective pen thickness. You can assign colors to pens using Tools  – Defaults  – Pen Thickness . Fills are always displayed using their own colors. When printing, you can assign a color to each of Allplan\\'s 256 basic colors in the Pen and Color Assignment  dialog box (Print Layo uts tool, Print profile  tab, Pen and color assignments... ). For more information on color layouts, see Printing color layouts (on page 293). 118 Basics Allplan 2020  Pen thickness and line color of text When you write text, Allplan displays the text with the pen thickness selected in the Properties  palette and the text color defined in the Text  dialog box or the settings for the current layer. In the   Options  - Text  page, you can configure the pen (and thus the color when Color stands for pen  is active) used for text to depend on the text height. For example, you can have text that is between 2.15 mm and 3 mm high be drawn with pen 1 and text that is between 3.00 mm and 4.25 mm high be drawn with pen 2. Installation, Basics Using format properties 119  If the Text relative to character height - Use fixed pen  option is not selected, the line color and thickness of text are based on the current pen thickness and line color in the Properties  palette or on the settings for the current layer. Line type no. 1 is always used to display text. For more information, see Rules defining how elements look on the screen (on page 109).  Pen thickness and line type of dimension lines and dimension text Dimension text and other dimension line texts in Allplan fonts The pen thickness used for dimension text and other dimension line texts in Allplan fonts is defined in the same way as the pen thickness used for normal text in Allplan fonts. In other words, dimension text uses the pen thickness of the font used or the font height. If both features are off, Allplan uses the settings currently defined in the  Properties  of the dimension line. The pen thickness and line type used to display dimension text depend on the following factors:  • Defaults - Fonts : You can specify that text always uses the pen thickness in the font defaults. Consequently, Allplan ignores all the settings described. To access the font defaults, go to the Tools  menu, click Defaults  and then Fonts . • Options - Text : You can specify that the pen thickness of text depends on the font height by selecting the Text relative to character height - Use fixed pen  option. To access the options for Text , go to the Quick Access Toolbar , click   Options  and then Text . Dimension text and other dimension line texts in TrueType fonts and OpenType fonts The pen thickness used for dimension text and other dimension line texts in TrueType fonts and OpenType fonts depends on the text size defined in the   Properties  of the dimension line. Boldface is possible. 120 Basics Allplan 2020  Layers and format properties Using the \"from layer\" format property Elements can assume the format properties (pen thickness, line type, line color) of the layer on which they are drawn. The relevant properties are then grayed out in the Properties  palette and   Modify Format Properties  dialog box. For more information, see Defining format properties based on layers (on page 121). Advantages of the “from layer” format property  • The elements\\' format properties are linked with the layers\\' format properties. When you change the format properties of a layer, the format properties of all the elements to which this layer is assigned change automatically. • You can work in a scale-independent manner when you use line styles. Note : When working with pen thickness and line color of text and pen thickness, line type and line color of dimension lines and dimension text, you have to consider special conditions that control the assignment of pen thickness and line color and that override the “from layer” property. Installation, Basics Using format properties 121  Defining format properties based on layers In the Layer  dialog box, you can specify that an element is to automatically assume the properties of the layer on which the element is drawn. This involves two steps:  • Open the Format Definition  tab and select one of the three options for matching the format properties of layers. This setting applies to the current project. It applies to all new elements and is valid until you explicitly change it. When you work with workgroup manager in a network environment, you must be signed in as the administrator. Otherwise, you cannot make any settings in this area.  • Switch to the Select Layer /Visibility  tab and specify the format properties (pen thickness, line type and line color) the program is to take from the layer. 122 Basics Allplan 2020  Using line styles You can use line styles to specify how elements look depending on the reference scale or drawing type. Requirements: You take the format properties from the layer in a fixed manner and use line styles.  The format properties (pen, line, color) you define for a layer can be saved to a named line style. Elements can then assume the format properties of this layer. You can define different line styles for various scale ranges or drawing types so that the way the elements look changes with the reference scale or drawing type. The program comes with a number of predefined line styles that are based on DIN 1356-1. Line styles are project resources. When creating a project, you can thus specify whether you want to use the line styles in the office standard or project-specific line styles. You can also use the As construction lines  setting for scale ranges or drawing types. Elements with this layer get the line type and line color of construction lines. However, these elements are not ‘real’ construction lines and therefore not found by the Construction -Line Format  filter. Line styles cannot be hidden . To hide a line style, you must hide the layer. For example, you can define a print set with the same name as a line style. You can then use this print to hide the corresponding layers. Important  Line styles and different settings for various scale ranges and drawing types require a well-thought-out approach! Installation, Basics Selecting elements 123  Selecting elements Selecting elements, overview To edit elements, you must select the elements. In Allplan you usually select the edit tool (for example, copy) first and then the elements to which you want to apply this tool. This also works the other way round in most edit tools: Select the elements first and then the tool. You can select elements either by clicking them or by defining a region around the elements you want to select. The tools in the Work Environment  area of the Actionbar , the selection shortcut menu  and the Filter Assistant  toolbar help you select elements. Tip:  When you right-click an element and select an edit tool on the shortcut menu, Allplan selects the element automatically. 124 Selecting elements, overview Allplan 2020   This table gives you an overview of selection options:  To do  this  Do this  Select an element. Click the element. Select several elements or regions. Open the   Brackets , click the elements or specify the regions. Then close the brackets. You can also open and close these metaphorical brackets by right-clicking in the workspace. Select elements in a region. To specify a selection rectangle: Use the left mouse button to open a selection rectangle. In the   Optio ns - Desktop environment  - Selection  page - Selection  area, you can specify that closing the selection rectangle requires a second click. When working with the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only. To specify a fence : Click   Fence  and enter the points defining the outline of the fence. Select all elements. In the case of some tools (for example, Export ), you can select all the elements in the current document by clicking All in the input options. This also selects elements that are not visible such as default reference planes. See also \"Behavior of default planes when copying or moving elements between documents\" in the Allplan Help. Reselect the elements that were selected last. Click   Reselect  (Actionbar  – Work Environment  area or Filter Assistant  toolbar). Select elements  with the same group number. Click one of the elements in the group with the middle mouse button and then left mouse button. Alternatively, select and hold the Shift key. Installation, Basics Selecting elements 125  Overview of tools for selecting elements Selection  Use  Fully bounded  Selects elements that are fully bounded by the selection rectangle only.  Fully bounded and intersected  Selects the elements that are fully bounded or intersected by the selection rectangle.  Intersected only  Selects elements that are intersected by the selection rectangle only.  Select elements based  on direction  Selection depends on the direction in which you enter the selection rectangle: • From right to left - selects the elements that are fully bounded or intersected by the selection rectangle. With this method, the selection rectangle is shown as dashed lines. • From left to right - selects elements that are fully bounded by the selection rectangle only.  Selection option for ambiguous elements on/off  You can choose the element to be selected if there are congruent elements. When this option is not selected, the program always selects the element that was created first (that is, the older one).  Reselect / Undo  Reselects the elements that were selected last or restores elements you have deleted as long as the   Delete  tool is selected.    Fence on/off  You can enter a selection fence. Click the first point again to close the polyline.  Brackets  Opens the brackets. All the elements you select after opening the brackets, whether selected in a rectangle, fence or individually, will be added to the selection. Click the brackets again to close them.   Note:  You can also find the tools for selecting elements on the Filter Assistant  toolbar or in the Work Environment  task area of the Actionbar .  Selecting elements by clicking When you are prompted to select an element, you can click a single  element to select it. To select several elements, turn on the  S  Brackets  (Actionbar  – Work Environment  area or Filter Assistant  toolbar). All the elements you click will be added to the \"selection\" until you close the brackets. 126 Selecting elements, overview Allplan 2020   Selecting elements by entering a region You can also select elements by specifying a region rather than clicking elements. When you use the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only.  The Selection area of the Actionbar and the Filter Assistant toolbar provide the following options:  •   Selects the elements that are fully bounded by the selection rectangle. •   Selects the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the selection rectangle. •   Selects the elements that are partially bounded by the selection rectangle. •   Selection depends on the direction in which you enter the selection rectangle: - Entering the region in the positive x-direction selects elements that are fully bounded by the region only. - Entering the region in the negative x-direction selects all the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the region. With this method, the selection rectangle is shown as dashed lines. Note:    Select elements based on direction  is the default. The selection rectangle is a colored area, which is indicated by the icons. The color of the area changes with the selection option you activate. The easiest way to enter the region is to select and hold the left mouse button and to enter two points that define diagonally opposite corners of a selection rectangle. You can also use  Fence  to enter a freeform region. Installation, Basics Selecting elements 127  Selecting elements by using the brackets You can use this tool to open the brackets. All the elements you select after opening the brackets, whether selected in a rectangle, fence or individually, will be added to the selection. Click the brackets again to close them. To use the brackets to select elements • Open the brackets by clicking   Brackets  (Actionbar  – Work Environment  area or Filter Assistant  toolbar). • Click elements or open selection rectangles or fences. • Close the brackets by clicking   Brackets .  Tip: Depending on the settings in the   Options  - Desktop environment  - Mouse and crosshairs  page - Mouse  area, you can also open and close these metaphorical brackets by right-clicking in the workspace. 128 Selection preview and element info Allplan 2020  Selection preview and element info When you point to an element but do not click, the entire element is displayed in the selection preview color  in plan, elevation and perspective view. The default setting is orange. Selection preview  is particularly useful for complex drawings, as you can see whether you have found the right element even before you select it.   Element info  provides additional support: In addition to selection preview, the element name and layer (default setting) are displayed with the crosshairs.      Pressing the TAB key displays additional information on 2D and 3D elements.   Note:  You can set the color, type and scope of Selection prev iew and Element info  in the   Options  on the Selection page. Installation, Basics Selecting elements 129  Working with filters By using filters, you can limit the selection of elements to specific types or properties. For example, you can use a filter that only selects elements of a certain color or walls of a specific thickness. Click the filter you want to use and define the properties by which you want to filter the elements. You always select the filter before you select the elements to which you want to apply the filter. Normally, you can select only element types that are available in the loaded drawing files. Allplan always applies the filter to the properties of elements; what you see on the screen is irrelevant. If you select several filters, they are linked by an AND connective. This means that Allplan selects only elements that match all filter criteria. You can find the filter tools in the following places:  • Actionbar  - Filter  area • Selection shortcut menu  • Filter Assistant  toolbar (not available with Actionbar configuration) 130 Working with filters Allplan 2020  Overview of filter options Filter  Use  Filter step by step  Applies a filter to elements you have already selected or filtered; you can define additional filter criteria.

You can match length values and coordinates from existing elements. In addition, you can do calculations in the dialog line or use the measuring tools and then transfer the results you obtain into the dialog line. Entering length values and coordinates General information In Allplan, you always enter length values and coordinates as real values. In other words, you do not need to recalculate the length each time to take the reference scale into account. For example, when designing a wall that is 8.60 m long, enter 8.6 (assuming that the unit of length is meters). Doing calculations in the dialog line You can also do calculations in the dialog line when the system prompts you to enter a length value. 134 Basics Allplan 2020  Transferring measured values Values obtained with   Measure  can be transferred directly to the dialog line. All you need to do is click the relevant value in the Measured values  dialog box. You can use   to copy the result to the clipboard and paste it into other Windows applications (Ctrl+V). Installation, Basics Precision drawing 135  Using drawing aids and a cursor snap angle When you draw linear elements (a wall or a line, for example), you can draw freely or you can restrict the direction in which you draw to a specific angle. You can make this setting on the right side of the dialog line.  You can restrict movement to horizontal and vertical (enter at right angles) or enter a cursor snap angle of your choice. The program considers the current setting for the system angle. If, for example, the system angle is 30°, then this is interpreted as being horizontal. Note : A cursor snap angle has priority over any point snap settings, as well as any other settings on the shortcut menu. This means that only points in alignment with one of the cursor snap angles will be snapped. You can use the following options in the dialog line to restrict cursor movement to a specific direction or angle:  Icon  Tool  Use  No icon pressed in The line can be drawn at any angle. This is the default setting.  Enter at right angles The line can be drawn only at right angles to the current system angle.  Cursor snap The line can be drawn only at specific angles. 15.00  Cursor snap angle Define the cursor snap angle here (only possible when   is turned on). 136 Basics Allplan 2020  Snapping to points While you are placing a point with the left mouse button, you can snap to points on existing elements. You can snap to the following types of points: end points, midpoints, division points and points of intersection. You do not need to know the coordinates of these points, nor is it necessary to work with construction lines. When CursorTips are selected, a symbol (known as a CursorTip) appears at the center of the crosshairs. The CursorTip shows the kind of point that has been detected in the snap radius. By using the  Options - Desktop environment - Point snap , you can define the types of points the system is to snap and whether the system is to scan active, edit or reference drawing files for points. By means of linear snap, you can align points exactly with existing points. Here, too, visual aids help you do this. Note : A cursor snap angle has priority over any point snap settings, as well as any other settings you define in the design aids . This means that only points in alignment with one of the cursor snap angles will be snapped. Installation, Basics Precision drawing 137  Using CursorT ips When CursorTips are activated, CursorTips appear at the center of the crosshairs before you place points. These CursorTips indicate the type of point detected within the snap radius. CursorTips appear after you have selected a drawing tool (the \"Line\" tool, for example) and move the crosshairs across the workspace. You can specify which types of points the system is to look for in   Point snap options  on the shortcut menu . Allplan uses the following CursorTips to indicate different types of points:   Icon  Meaning   Free point:  There is no defined point within the snap radius. The circle represents the size of the snap radius.  End point:  Snaps to the nearest element endpoint. This option cannot be deactivated.  Intersection:  Snaps to the point of intersection between two elements within the snap radius.  Midpoint:  Snaps to the nearest midpoint of a line or polygon within the snap radius.  Tangential point:  Snaps to the nearest tangential point of an arc, circle or ellipse.  Quadrant point:  Snaps to the nearest quadrant point on an arc, circle or ellipse.  Grid point:  Snaps to the nearest grid point within the snap radius. To define the grid, use   Grid Settings . The grid is only visible when   Grid on/off  (View  menu or Special  toolbar) is selected. Grid points are snapped even when the grid is not visible.  Reference point of dimension lines:  Snaps to existing reference points when you draw dimension lines.  Linea r snap with Ctrl+left mouse button:  Snaps to the nearest point within the snap radius while you are placing points. Thus, you can quickly draw mutually perpendicular lines. This option cannot be turned off.  Element:  Snaps to the nearest point on an element within the snap radius. 138 Basics Allplan 2020  Snapping to points with the left mouse button You can snap to points on existing elements. These points include endpoints, midpoints, division points and points of intersection. You do not need to know the coordinates of these points, nor is it necessary to work with construction lines. Allplan scans for points within a defined radius about the crosshairs. This means that when you point or click in the workspace, the system ”snaps” to points within a specific distance (the snap radius), even if the center of the crosshairs is not positioned directly over the point. You can define the size of the snap radius in  Point snap options  (on the shortcut menu ) in the Point snap  area. Depending on the setting in the   Point snap options , the snap radius can apply to the active drawing files only or apply to drawing files open in reference mode too.  (A) Crosshairs (B) Snap radius (1) The program snaps to the coordinates of this point, because it is within the snap radius. Note : In the   Options - Desktop environment - Point snap page - Point snap area , you can configure the system to emit an acoustic signal whenever you click an undefined point. Installation, Basics Precision drawing 139  Linear snap Use Linear snap to place points so that they are in direct alignment with existing points. To do this, use Ctrl+left mouse button. If the program finds a point within the snap radius, it places the point in such a manner that it is exactly aligned with the nearest point found inside the snap radius. Alignment is based on the selected system angle. If the Display CursorTips - Linear snap  option is selected in the Point snap representation  area of the   Point snap options , the program highlights the points that are in perpendicular alignment before you select a button and creates temporary construction lines stretching to the point. This provides a better visual check when you use the linear snap tool.  (A) Crosshairs (B) Snap radius (1) Linear snap (2) Point snapped Tip:  Drafting with linear snap is mainly useful with drawings consisting of few design entities. It becomes more difficult to align with the correct point as the number of design entities increases. 140 Basics Allplan 2020  Precision drawing with the grid When you turn on the grid by selecting   Grid on/off  (View  menu or View  drop-down list on the Quick Access Toolbar ), you can see a dot grid in all viewports of the current project; this grid stretches across the entire workspace. The grid serves as a means of visual orientation, as well as for point snapping. The grid points themselves do not appear in printouts. When the Grid point  option is selected in the Point snap  area of the  Point snap options , you can use the grid points as snap points. If you clear all the other check boxes and turn off point snap in all drawing files, the cursor will snap to grid points only. Note : Grid points are snapped even when the grid is not visible. Use   Grid on/off  to show and hide the grid. Use   Grid Settings  (View  menu or View  drop-down list on the Quick Access Toolbar ) to define the spacing between grid points in the x-direction and y-direction. When creating the grid, the program takes the current system angle into account. Installation, Basics Precision drawing 141 142 Basics Allplan 2020  Point snap methods When snapping and entering points, you can find a number of helpful tools in the dialog line and on the shortcut menu (point assistant). These tools and options are only available when the program expects you to enter a point, for example, after you have selected a tool for creating elements. Tools and options on the shortcut menu  Icon  Point snap  Use     Last point  Uses the last point entered.  Additional point for offset  The point snapped is fixed; the offset values entered in the x-direction, y-direction and z-direction apply to this point even if the crosshairs snap to other points.  Lock coordinate  Uses the current coordinate as the fixed coordinate. You can select the x-coordinate, y-coordinate or z-coordinate or a combination thereof on a submenu.  Fixed X  All point entries you make apply to the x-coordinate snapped. Thus, you can place points in exact alignment with existing points.  Fixed Y  All point entries you make apply to the y-coordinate snapped. Thus, you can place points in exact alignment with existing points.  Fixed Z  All point entries you make apply to the z-coordinate snapped. Thus, you can place points in exact alignment with existing points.  Use coordinates  Uses the coordinates of the next point you click (only available if Global point is selected). Installation, Basics Precision drawing 143   Point of intersection  Snaps to the point of intersection between two elements.  Midpoint  Finds the midpoint of an element (for example, a line) or a line that you enter. When you apply this tool to circles and ellipses, the centers of these elements are snapped.  Center of arc  Finds the midpoint of an arc, ellipse, part of an ellipse or spline.  Division point  Divides a line that you enter or an element into an arbitrary number of segments. The division points can be addressed by clicking or entering a number.  Base of perpendicular  Finds the point on an element that is obtained by dropping a perpendicular line from an arbitrary point onto the element.  Reference point  Places a point on an element that is at a specific distance from a (reference) point. The reference point appears as a direction symbol at either the start or the end of the element, depending on which is nearest to the point you clicked. The dialog line shows the distance between the reference point and the contact point.  Offset by radius  Finds a point obtained from the point of intersection of two new circles that you enter.  Track,  extension point  Places a point on a track line.  Delete track points  Deletes all the track points placed; the track lines will be recalculated.  options - point snap  Opens the Options  dialog box, displaying the Point snap  page. You can specify snap options and make settings for point snap and CursorTips.  Track tracing options  Opens the Options  dialog box, displaying the Track tracing  page.

Cursor snap  The line can be drawn only at specific angles. 15.00  Cursor snap angle  Define the cursor snap angle here (only possible when   is turned on).   Precision dr awing Allplan provides a wide range of options to help you enter points. Placing points can be precise - based on values that you enter at the keyboard - or it can be intuitive. During input, the preview of an element changes constantly as you move the crosshairs across the workspace. The element you are entering is always visible in the preview as it will actually be placed in the workspace later, which means that the position of the element in the preview adapts to the point snapped by the crosshairs. Elements which can be snapped appear in the selection color. These options facilitate creative design work, as you can enter points quickly. Thus, you can easily edit very complex drawings consisting of countless points.  Entering points by using the dialog line Whenever you click a tool which expects you to enter points, you can see the following boxes and icons in the dialog line:  You can also find the z-direction wherever the third dimension is required, for example in Modeling : 146 Basics Allplan 2020  Preview snaps to points You can snap points and place them by using the mouse. You can also enter points and elements based on existing points: Point to a point and the program will snap to it and mark it with a red X.  Figure: Point snapped; highlighted by a red X Note: Points snapped are visible in all views. All the entries you make in the dialog line apply to the point snapped. Use the Tab or Page up key or Shift+Tab or Page down key to switch between the boxes. You can also calculate.  Figure: calculations: DX=4x2=8; DY=4/3=1.333 Installation, Basics Precision drawing 147  Preview shows all points The preview simultaneously displays the entries you make in the dialog line. A red cross immediately appears at the point defined by the values entered.  Figure: Preview of point, offset of dx = 2, dy = 3 to point snapped When you select the Enter key or click in the workspace, the point you have just entered serves as the starting point for the new element (line in this example) or as the reference point for modification tools.  Figure: Select the Enter key or click in the workspace to place the point; the line is attached to the crosshairs. 148 Basics Allplan 2020  Before you place the point, you can also point to another point: the offset you enter in the dialog line refers to the new point snapped.   Figure: Preview of point, offset of dx = 2, dy = 3 refers to new point Reference to point snapped or point placed? When making entries in the dialog line, you can see at once whether your entries refer to a point snapped or to the point you placed last: • In the case of points snapped, the boxes are highlighted in yellow. • In the case of points placed, the boxes are highlighted in white. Value entered is proposed The icons to the left of the boxes are buttons:  When you click an icon, the program proposes the value entered for all further steps; however, you can change the value any time.  Figure: dy = 3 is proposed for the next point snapped Installation, Basics Precision drawing 149  Transferring values to boxes by clicking Boxes provide shortcut menus, which you can use to get values from the drawing by clicking.

While working, you can see a ToolTip with the offset to the starting point of the wall in the x-direction and y-direction.  You can place the end point of the rectangular wall only in the selected grid.   Tip:  The \"rasterize length\" option is very useful for working in animation. Tip:  If   Rasterize length  is active, you can use the Tab key to quickly switch between Basic dimensions , Outside dimensions - and Opening dimensions +  while drawing. Tip:  You can also use the “rasterize length” option when drawing with track lines. Installation, Basics Using track lines 153  Using track lines T rack lines Track lines make it easier for you to design intuitively, saving you a lot of time and effort as you do not need to draw construction lines. By pointing to existing elements, you can pick up to five track points. These track points picked are marked with symbols, defining the type of track line you can see. Instead of pointing to an element and waiting until the program automatically activates track tracing, you can also click  Track point  on the shortcut menu and place a track point. By using   Delete track points , you can delete all track points and start again.  Tip:  Track points snapped are marked by rectangles appearing around the track point or point snap symbol. 154 Possible track lines Allplan 2020  Possible track lines Extension After activating a design tool, point to the starting point or end point of an element. When you move the crosshairs along the extension of the element, the program displays a track line stretching from this element. If you have two track lines of this type, you can also work with the virtual point where the two lines intersect.   Orthogonal track lines After you have selected a drawing tool, move the preview of the element roughly in the direction of the x-axis or y-axis. You can see the nearest horizontal or vertical track line. Installation, Basics Using track lines 155  Polar track lines Polar track lines complement orthogonal track lines. After you have selected a drawing tool, move the preview of the element roughly at the cursor snap angle selected for polar track lines. You can see the nearest track line that matches this angle.   Perpendicular After you have selected a drawing tool, point to an existing element roughly where you want to drop the perpendicular. Wait until the program displays the appropriate symbol. When you move the crosshairs along the extension of the perpendicular, a track line appears. You can now click a point on the element or track line or enter the length of the perpendicular in the dialog line. 156 Possible track lines Allplan 2020  Par allel line After you have selected a drawing tool, point to a linear element somewhere between the element\\'s midpoint and end. Wait until the program displays the symbol for parallel track lines . By the way, you can specify this time limit in the Track tracing options . You can now click a point on the track line or enter the length of the element in the dialog line.  Assumed point of intersection After activating a design tool, point to the starting point or end point of existing elements one after the other. When you point to the assumed point where these elements intersect, the program displays the extensions of the elements you have picked and the assumed point of intersection.  You can also use track lines with 3D solids. The following illustration shows a truncated cone whose edges are extended to the virtual vertex. Installation, Basics Using track lines 157  Entering lengths by using track lines Entering length values via the preview When you move the preview of an element along a track line, you can see the current length of the element. This length is a multiple of the value specified for   Rasterize length  in the dialog line (even when   Rasterize length  is not active). Entering numeric length values in the dialog line • As long as the preview of an element has not snapped to a track line or point, the values you enter apply to the starting point of the element. You can enter values for the x-coordinate, y-coordinate or z-coordinate in the dialog line. See precision drawing. • As soon as the program snaps to an existing point or track point, the values relate to the point snapped. See Entering points relative to existing points • When the program snaps to a track line, you can enter values in the dialog line. To do this, use  Offset to reference point  (starting point of element) and   Offset length  (track line). 158 Turning on and customizing track tracing Allplan 2020  T urning on and customizing track tracing You can customize track tracing  to suit your needs: Select a tool for creating an element (for example, Line ) and click   Track tracing options  on the shortcut menu. You can turn off some options or you can even turn off track tracing completely on the Track tracing  page in the Options - Desktop environment . You can also specify the time (in milliseconds) it takes the program to select track points.  Customizing track tracing on the Track tracing  page in the Options - Desktop environment   Tip:  You can quickly turn track tracing  on and off while you are entering elements. Just select the F11 key or click   Track line  in the dialog line. Installation, Basics Modifying objects directly 159  Modifying objects directly Allplan provides numerous options for editing design entities. The most important editing options found on the Actionbar, menus or toolbars can also be accessed straight from the elements. You can use direct object modification to move, rotate, mirror and copy elements immediately after you have selected them. In addition, you can modify the element geometry and change other object-specific properties. Basically, you need to differentiate between two different objectives: You want to edit an element generally: For example, move, rotate, mirror or copy the entire element, which means that the element itself remains unchanged. You want to edit an element individually: For example, resize the element, which means that its geometry or properties change. Whichever approach you take, the benefits are the same:  • Thanks to direct object modification, you always have the most important edit tools close at hand. • You can change the most important geometric parameters of an element without palettes or dialog boxes. • The optimized workflow reduces the number of mouse clicks and the distance covered by the mouse to a minimum. • Direct object modification works in both 2D and 3D. 160 Basics Allplan 2020  Basics Selecting direct object modification Direct object modification must be on if you want to edit elements in this way. Open the   Options  - Desktop environment  - Direct object modification  page and select the Display  handles  option in the Handles  area (see also \"Turning on direct object modification\" in the Allplan Help).  Selecting elements First, select the elements you want to edit by means of direct object modification. To do this, click the elements or enclose them in a selection rectangle. The following table gives you a brief overview of the most important options for selecting elements: \\uf0dc No tool is selected.   To do this  Do this  Select a single element Click element Select several elements Click in the workspace, select and hold the mouse button and enclose the elements in a selection rectangle Select additional elements Select the CTRL key and click the additional elements or enclose them in a selection rectangle Select all elements.

You can specify colors in the   Options  - Desktop environm ent - Direct object modification  - Handles . You can also define the transparency of handles there. Handles in general:  All handles you can use with the selected elements appear in the color you have specified for the default color .  Handle within snap radius:  If the crosshairs are within the snap radius of a handle, the color of this handle changes to the color you have specified for the selection preview color . Click to select this handle; the editing option that is subsequently available to you depends on the handle type (see \"Types of handles (on page 162)\"). 164 Basics Allplan 2020  Selected handles:  The handles to which the subsequent editing option applies appear in the color you have specified for the selection color .   Entry boxes You can use boxes to enter values defining the geometry of an element. These boxes are only visible when you select a single element.   Tip: You can use the Visibility when element is selected  option  (  Options  - Desktop environment  - Direct object modification  - Boxes ) to define whether boxes open immediately after you have selected an element or not until you select the Spacebar. Installation, Basics Modifying objects directly 165  Toggles Toggles, which are always close to boxes, are only visible when you select a single element.

Locking or unlocking the angle  When editing inclined elements, you can choose to lock or unlock the inclination angle relative to the horizontal. Angle locked (value cannot be edited):  The inclination angle of the element remains constant. The program automatically calculates the delta values resulting from changes in values. Angle unlocked (value can be edited):    You can change the inclination angle of the element relative to the horizontal. To do this, you can enter values directly or have the program calculate the values automatically from changes in the x, y and z-values. To lock or unlock the angle, click the  Lock angle  or   Unlock angle  toggle. Installation, Basics Modifying objects directly 167  Context toolbar The context toolbar  exists in two forms: • When you point to a selected element, the context toolbar  provides the tools that are familiar to you from the Actionbar  - Edit  area:   Move ,   Copy ,   Rotate ,   Copy and Mirror  and   Rotate 3D Elements .   • When you point to a point of an existing element (does not have to be a handle or part of a selected element; can also be any additional point such as the center of a circle), the context toolbar  provides these tools with advanced functionality: The point snapped automatically serves as the starting point for the next tool you select.     Coordinate dialog box When you move elements, the following coordinat e dialog box  opens close to the starting point or close to the crosshairs (if you have snapped the end point):  Enter the delta values for the move based on the starting point (the boxes are highlighted in white) or based on any other reference point currently snapped (the boxes are highlighted in yellow). When you copy elements, the following coordinate dialog box  opens close to the starting point or close to the crosshairs (if you have snapped the end point):  Enter the delta values for the first copy based on the starting point (the boxes are highlighted in white) or based on any other reference point currently snapped (the boxes are highlighted in yellow). In addition, specify the number of copies.   Tip: You can specify the time that is to elapse until the context toolbar  appears. Select the   Options  - Desktop environment  - Direct object modification  - Context toolbar  and enter a value from 300 to 20,000 milliseconds for the Time limit . Here, you can also add more tools to the context toolbar . 168 Basics Allplan 2020  Modifying objects generally To edit and copy elements or element groups in their entirety, you can use the   Central move handle  and the context toolbar .   Modifying objects individually When you select a single element (for example, a rectangle, circle or wall), the program presents not only the handles but also the most important geometric parameters. By changing the values, you can directly modify the geometry of the element. Installation, Basics Using wizards 169  Using wizards The Wizards  palette (on page 39) provides wizards as tabs. A wizard is a pictogram-like legend representing tools you use frequently. In addition, you can use wizards to work with predefined content. You can match all attributes and parameters of elements from the wizard. You do not need to define any element properties. Right -clicking an element opens a shortcut menu with the following options:  • The tool that was used to create the element is at the top of the shortcut menu. The element gets the most recent properties; it does not take the parameters and attributes from the wizard. • By clicking   Match , you open the tool that was used to create the element. In addition, you take all the parameters and attributes from the wizard.  This is equivalent to double-clicking the element with the right mouse button. •   Conversion for Building Alteration Work  is available for most architectural elements. This matches the building alteration category of the element clicked. If you have not assigned a building alteration category, Allplan automatically uses the New building  category. Allplan comes with several predefined wizard files, but you can also create your own wizards. You can find the predefined wizards in the \\\\ETC\\\\Assistent folder. In addition, you can purchase wizards with content. • You can save drawing files and NDW files as wizards. To do this, click the Allplan icon , select Save copy as  and the Wizard (*.nas)  file type. • You can save wizards as NDW files or drawing files. To do this, right-click in the wizard window and select the required tool. 170 Organizing wizards Allplan 2020  Organizing wizards Wizards are combined in groups. You can find the wizards in a group as tabs in the Wizards  palette. You can select a wizard group by clicking in the list box at the top of the Wizards  palette. Wizard groups are saved to a *.nagd file. You can use Add group...  on the shortcut menu to select an existing *.nagd file and add this file to the palette (when you want to use a wizard group of a colleague, for example). A wizard group file is a text file, containing references to the wizard files (*.nas). The path saved is a relative path. You can use the shortcut menu of a tab to add, remove, replace and rename tabs. You can use drag-and-drop editing to change the arrangement of the tabs. The ToolTip of a tab shows the path and file name of the associated wizard file. Note : The wizards that come with Allplan are in the \\\\etc\\\\Assistent folder. You can find them in the Allplan  group. You cannot change the wizards in this group. If you want to define your own wizards, you must create a new wizard group first. When you open a country-specific project, Allplan displays the country-specific wizards, adding the country code to the group name (for example, Allplan.eng ) Installation, Basics Using wizards 171  Using elements from wizards Elements in wizards can be used in three different ways:  • Right-click an element and select the required tool on the shortcut menu. - The tool that was used to create the element is at the top of the shortcut menu. The parameters and attributes of the element in the wizard are not copied. - By clicking   Match , you open the tool that was used to create the element. In addition, you take all the parameters and attributes from the wizard. • Double-click an element with the right mouse button. This selects the relevant tool and copies the element\\'s parameters. • Copy elements from the wizard and place them in the workspace (by using the drag-and-drop feature or selecting Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V). Note : Wizards assume the drawing type of the active viewport. 172  Allplan 2020 Installation, Basics Entering polylines and areas 173  Entering polylines and areas Polyline entry tools You can use the polyline entry tools to enter polylines and polygonal-bounded areas. The polyline entry tools are used by countless Allplan functions; for example, when you enter hatching, apply a fill or define a room. You can enter the polyline from scratch by using the drawing aids in the dialog line or on the shortcut menu. As an alternative, you can use existing outlines or elements.  Tip: The easiest way to enter a rectangle is to click two diagonally opposite points and select the Esc key. 174 Basic polyline entry rules Allplan 2020  Basic polyline entry rules • Entering two points and selecting the Esc key creates a rectangle. • Polylines that must be closed (for example, for hatching) close automatically when you select the Esc key or click the first point again. • When you click an element, you can either define a point on the element or choose to use the entire element or parts thereof as the outline. • In the Input Options , you can control how the polyline entry tools behave. • You can create areas composed of any number of areas by clicking   Multi  in the Input Options . By using   Plus  and   Minus , you can then define whether you want to add the area to the overall area or subtract the area from the overall area. • To quickly select closed outlines, you can use   Area detection in the input options for entering polylines . Select   Island detection  if you want the program to automatically detect and cut out closed outlines within an area.  Input options for entering polylines, overview The Input Options  open whenever you select a tool that uses polyline entry tools (for example, pattern, hatching, room). You can use these options to specify how the polyline entry tools handle architectural lines and how these tools behave when you generate polylines based on existing elements. Installation, Basics Entering polylines and areas 175  Entering areas   Single  Use this to create single , discrete areas.  Multi  Use this to create areas composed of several polygons. Hatching, patterns or fills get the same group number; rooms are handled as a single entity. Consequently, you can define separate rooms, which Allplan then analyzes as a single room.  Plus,   Minus  If you select   Multi , you can use   Plus  and   Minus  in the input options to specify whether each new polygon you enter will be added to or subtracted from the overall area. Polygoni zing existing elements  Polygonize elements on/off  When the check box is not selected, Allplan ignores elements when you click them. In this mode, Allplan detects points only. When the check box is selected, Allplan polygonizes the elements you click. You can use the options next to this check box to specify the type of polygonization.  Polygonize entire element  This uses the entire element that you clicked. The starting point defines the direction of polygonization. If the last point in the polyline coincides with the starting point or end point of the element, you do not need to specify the direction.  Use this option when the outline consists of entire elements.  Define area of element to polygonize  With this option, the program prompts you for the area with every element you click (from point, to point).  Use this option when the outline consists of segments.  Enter reference point  With this option, the program prompts you for the reference point with every element you click. This option uses a point on the element 176 Input options for entering polylines, overview Allplan 2020  you clicked with a defined offset to the reference point. Click to define a new reference point and then enter the offset to the reference point. Use this option when you want to specify the outline based on existing elements (when you enter a dormer, for example).  Area detection using additional point   Area detection using additional point  combines areas bounded by lines and polylines to form a polygon. Allplan uses the inner boundaries or outer boundaries depending on whether the temporary point is inside or outside the outline.  By selecting  Element filter , you can configure the program to ignore architectural lines when detecting areas.  Area detection  You can use   Area detection  to automatically detect the outlines of closed polygons. You can use closed areas delimited by design entities of any kind as an outline polygon simply by clicking anywhere within the area. Allplan automatically detects and polygonizes the entire outline. The boundary elements can have points in common; they can intersect or touch. You can turn this automation feature on and off at any time. Note:  The Minimum distance between points  setting in the   Options  on the Desktop environment  page also applies to the  Area detec tion  tool. To make sure that Allplan detects outlines with small gaps, you can increase the minimum distance between points temporarily.  Island detection,   Inverse island detection:   Island detection  detects closed outlines within an area and cuts them out automatically.   Inverse island detection  does not cut out closed outlines but fills these outlines with the selected surface element. It is the area around the \\'island\\' that remains empty. You can use these tools only together with   Area detection using additional point  and   Area detection . Installation, Basics Entering polylines and areas 177  Number of segments / Rise   Number of segments  The polygonization value is interpreted as the number of segments. The value for   Number of segments  defines the number of segments used to approximate a curve. In the case of a circle, for example, 120 means that a full circle is approximated by a 120-sided polygon. The higher the degree of accuracy you need or the larger the radius, the greater the number of segments should be used to approximate a circle. You can enter a value between 36 and 360.  (A) Segments in circle = 36; this will produce an angle of 10°  Rise  The polygonization value is interpreted as the rise. The value you enter for   Rise  defines the maximum rise of the secant relative to the arc (in mm). As a result, the curve is polygonized so that the maximum offset of the polyline\\'s segment to the curve is less than or equal to the value you specified. This setting produces more accurate results than the number of segments.  (B) Rise (38mm or less) 178 Input options for entering polylines, overview Allplan 2020  Element filter   Element filter  Ignore plan lines of architectural elements  Ignore 2D surface elements (hatching, patterns, fills, bitmap areas, smart fit placements)  when using area detection  When you select the   Element filter , Allplan ignores lines of architectural elements and 2D surface elements when you use   Area detection  or   Area detection using additional point .  Use this option if you want to automatically apply surface elements like hatching, patterns to adjacent outlines that are separated by arcs, splines or curves. Here is some background information: Allplan polygonizes curves based on the number of segments specified. When you enter a second (third...) area, Area detection  can take a long time or produce incorrect results, because Allplan detects both the outline of the surface (2D line) and the boundary line of the polyline of the first area. Back, Help   Back  This undoes the last point you entered.  Help for entering polylines  This displays help for the polyline entry tools . Installation, Basics Applying surface elements 179  Applying surface elements Hatching, pattern, fill, bitmap area and style area You can apply hatching, patterns or fills to areas to define different materials or to highlight areas. In addition, you can apply bitmaps to areas or use architectural area styles for 2D areas (we will use the term \"surface element\" to refer to the wide range of options provided by Allplan). The library of hatching styles that comes with Allplan provides a wide range of hatching styles and patterns. However, you can also define your own hatching styles and patterns (click Defaults  on the Tools  menu) or modify those that come with the program. You can display the boundary of hatching, patterns and fills as a construction line by selecting the appropriate option in   Show/Hide . You are advised to use the polyline entry tools to enter areas to which you want to apply a surface element, such as hatching, pattern, fill. 180 Hatching, pattern, fill, bitmap area and style area Allplan 2020   The following tools are available for entering filled areas:   Icon  Tool  Use  Hatching You can use this tool to apply hatching to an area.  Pattern You can use this tool to apply a pattern to an area.  Fill You can use this tool to apply a color fill to an area.  Bitmap Area You can use this tool to place bitmap images in areas.  Style Area You can use this tool to apply architectural area styles to 2D areas.   The following tools are available for modifying filled areas:   Icon  Tool  Use  Reshape Surface Element, Architectural Area You can use this tool to add areas to hatching, patterns, fills, bitmaps or architectural elements (slabs, rooms, net stories, floors, ceilings, roof covering) or remove such areas.  Split Surface Elements, Archit. Elements You can use this tool to split hatching, patterns, fills, bitmaps and architectural elements (walls, columns, slabs, beams, upstands, rooms, net stories, floors, ceilings) into two parts. This can be useful if you have to split up the 3D plan for creating the layout.  Merge Surface Elements, Archit. Elements You can use this tool to merge areas of hatching, patterns, fills, bitmaps and architectural elements (walls, slabs, beams, upstands, rooms, net stories, floors and ceilings) to form a single element.  Convert Surface Element You can use this tool to convert surface elements (hatching, patterns, fills or bitmaps) to surface elements of the same or different type. You can also use this tool to modify the properties of a surface element.  Stretch Entities You can use this tool to modify the outline of filled areas. Installation, Basics Applying surface elements 181  Hatching and scale Whenever you apply hatching, you can specify whether the spacing between the hatching lines is to remain constant or change dynamically with the reference scale. This means that you can distinguish between hatching used to display real objects, and symbolic hatching, e.g., concrete hatching. Tiles should appear larger or smaller depending on the selected reference scale. Symbolic hatching, on the other hand, should have the same spacing between lines regardless of scale. You can make this setting in two places  • In the hatching properties when you create an area with hatching: Here, you can specify whether the hatching is to adapt to the scale or remain constant, regardless of the scale.  • In hatching defaults: You can set the spacing between hatching lines (for the Adjust to scale in layout  setting) and the scale to which the line spacing is to apply. This setting also defines how component hatching behaves.   Note : Changing the defaults changes all the areas with this hatching style. 182 Hatching and scale Allplan 2020  “Constant in layout” hatching setting When you select Constant in layout , the spacing between hatching lines is always constant in layouts, regardless of the scale. Components like walls are based on this setting when Reference scale for adjusting line spacing so that it is true to scale  is 1 in the hatching defaults. Hatching in layouts looks different from hatching in documents. It is the way hatching looks in layouts that is of relevance. Representation in layout The spacing between hatching lines is the same at 1:50 as at 1:100, but the number of lines doubles. The spacing is based on the value entered for the line spacing in the hatching defaults (regardless of the scale).  Representation in document As the number of hatching lines doubles, the way hatching looks in documents changes dynamically with the reference scale. Installation, Basics Applying surface elements 183  “Adjust to scale in layout” hatching setting When you select Adjust to scale in layout , the spacing between hatching lines changes dynamically with the scale. Components like walls are based on this setting when you enter a value that is greater than 1 for Reference scale for adjusting line spacing so that it is true to scale  in the hatching defaults. Hatching in layouts looks different from hatching in documents. It is the way hatching looks in layouts that is of relevance. Representation in layout The spacing between the hatching lines is twice as large at 1:50 as at 1:100, but the number of lines remains constant. The spacing is based on the value entered for the line spacing in the hatching defaults and on the reference scale.  For example : You use hatching 1 with the following settings: Line spacing is 3 mm and the reference scale for adjusting line spacing so that it is true to scale is 1:100. By selecting the Adjust to scale in layout  setting, you create hatching in the document and place the hatching in the layout at a scale of 1:50. Allplan calculates the spacing between the hatching lines in the layout as follows: Line spacing (from defaults): reference scale x scale of layout; that is, in this example: 3mm: 1/100 x 1/50 = 6 mm. This produces a line spacing of 3 mm at a layout scale of 1:10. 184 Hatching and scale Allplan 2020  Representation in document As the number of hatching lines remains constant, the way hatching looks in documents does not change even when you change the reference scale.     Applying hatching to architectural components Hatching can be applied to architectural components like walls. The setting in the hatching defaults defines how hatching applied to components behaves with different reference scales.  • When Reference scale for adjusting line spacing so that it is true to scale  is 1, the hatching behaves as if the Constant in layout  option was selected. In other words, the spacing between the hatching lines always stays the same, regardless of the scale. This setting is usually used. See “Constant in layout” hatching setting on page  182. • If Adjust to scale in layout; reference scale based on defaults  is greater than 1, hatching behaves as if the Adjust to scale in layout  option was on. In other words, the spacing between the hatching lines changes dynamically with the scale. See “Adjust to scale in layout” hatching setting on page  183. Installation, Basics Applying surface elements 185  Pattern and scale The size of a pattern or pattern element and how it looks at different reference scales depend on three factors: • The height and width of a pattern element. You can define these values in the pattern defaults (on the Tools  menu - Defaults  - Pattern ). • The Adjust to scale in layout  and Constant in layout  resizing options. You can select these options in the pattern parameters (Pattern  tool - Properties ).  • The values for the height and width factor of the pattern. You can also enter these values in the pattern parameters.   “Constant in layout” pattern setting When you select Constant in layout , the size of the pattern elements is always constant in layouts, regardless of the scale at which the layout elements are placed. Patterns in layouts look different from patterns in documents. It is the way hatching looks in layouts that is of relevance. 186 Pattern and scale Allplan 2020  Representation in layout The size of the pattern elements is the same at 1:50 as at 1:100, but the number of pattern elements doubles. The size is based on the value entered in the pattern defaults and on the width/height factor, which is defined in the pattern parameters.  For example : You use pattern 301 and the height of one pattern element should be 10 mm in the layout. In the pattern defaults, a height of 100 mm is defined for pattern 301. Therefore, you must enter a factor of 0.10 in the pattern parameters (pattern height x factor = height of one pattern element in the layout). This returns a height of 10 mm (100 mm x 10), regardless of the scale. Representation in document As the number of pattern elements doubles, the way the pattern looks in documents changes dynamically with the reference scale. Installation, Basics Applying surface elements 187  “Adjust to scale in layout” pattern setting When you select Adjust to scale in layout , the size of the pattern elements in the layout changes dynamically with the scale at which the layout elements have been placed. Components like walls are based on this setting. Patterns in layouts look different from patterns in documents. It is the way hatching looks in layouts that is of relevance. Representation in layout The size of the pattern elements is twice as large at 1:50 as at 1:100, but the number of pattern elements remains constant. The size of a single pattern element depends on the following settings: the value in the pattern defaults, the height/width factor specified in the pattern parameters and the scale at which the layout element was placed.   For example : You use pattern 301 and the height of one pattern element in the layout should be 10 mm in the layout. In the pattern defaults, a height of 100 mm is defined for pattern 301. Therefore, you must enter a factor of 10 in the pattern parameters (height of a pattern element in the layout = pattern height defined in the defaults x factor x layout scale). At a scale of 1:100, the height is 10 mm (100 mm x 10 x 1/100); at a scale of 1:50, the height is 20 mm. Representation in document As the number of pattern elements remains constant, the way the pattern looks in documents does not change even when you change the reference scale. 188 Pattern and scale Allplan 2020  Applying patterns to architectural components Patterns can be applied to architectural components like walls. These patterns behave as if the Adjust to scale in plan  option was selected. See “Adjust to scale in layout” pattern setting on page  187. Note: The program always displays walls with one pattern element per layer, regardless of the wall width and the size of a pattern element. Installation, Basics Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults 189  Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults Saving default settings in dialog boxes You can save frequently used texts or values in dialog boxes and retrieve these values whenever you need them. For example, you can enter and save different values for wall thickness in the Thickness  dialog box or different materials in the Material  dialog box.    Click   to add new values or texts. Click   to find entries or to enter a value or text that is not saved to the dialog box. Click   to remove values. You can delete only values you defined yourself. 190 Saving and loading parameters as favorites Allplan 2020  Saving and loading parameters as favorites You can define frequently used parameters as favorites in almost all palettes and dialog boxes. You can store these favorites in a component-specific library. This is especially useful if you work in a team. The use of favorites and defaults not only means that they are readily available, but also reduces the risk of errors. For example, you can save walls, doors, windows, dimension lines or light settings as favorites. All you need to do is click  Save as a favorite  in the palette or in the Properties  dialog box. This example shows the Properties  dialog box for a slab opening.  Note:  The current layer is also saved. When you retrieve favorite files later, this layer automatically becomes the current layer. Use   Save as a favorite  to save all parameters as a favorite file. Favorite files get element-specific or component-specific file name extensions. Use   Load favorite  to retrieve favorite files. Installation, Basics Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults 191  Using symbols A symbol is essentially a file consisting of any number of design entities. Symbols can be used repeatedly within a drawing. The size of a symbol is practically unlimited. You can even save an entire drawing file as a symbol. You can save and retrieve symbols by using the Library  palette. Allplan comes with libraries including symbols. But you can also create your own symbols. Symbols pr ovide the following advantages:  • You can create a library of symbols that contains frequently used components in your office standard. Instead of drawing the component from scratch each time, just retrieve the symbol from the library. • Symbols are placed as an entity group. This means that they can be addressed (click the middle mouse button followed by the left mouse button or by selecting Shift while clicking) and modified as a single entity. You can also modify each individual element separately. • You can access the symbols in the libraries that come with Allplan. Symbols automatically adapt to the reference scale. If your symbols contain text, these symbols can change with the reference scale. 192 Using symbols Allplan 2020  Inserting profiles from Bimplus in the Allplan library You can take profiles as symbols from the Nemetschek profile catalog in Bimplus, adding these symbols to the office folder of the Allplan library. To insert profi les from Bimplus in the Allplan library  1 Open the Library  palette (on page 41) and click   Nemetschek profile catalog  at the bottom of the palette. 2 Sign in to Bimplus. The Nemetschek Profile Catalog  dialog box opens. 3 Go to the Profiles  area and select a group of cross-sections. 4 Go to the Profile shapes  area and select a group of profiles. If you want to insert some profiles of the selected profile group in Allplan, select these profiles in the Profile dimensions  area. To do this, use the Ctrl and Shift keys. Note : You can also select several profile groups in a single step. In this case, you cannot select profiles individually. You can display country-specific profiles in the Profile selection  list box. 5 Click Add selected profile groups  or Add selected profile) . The Profiles selected  area lists the profile groups and profiles selected. You can change the selection of profiles to be added by selecting entries and clicking Remove from selected profiles . 6 Add more profile groups or profiles as described. 7 Click Copy  to copy the selected profiles to the office folder of the Allplan library. Allplan displays a message, closing the dialog box. The office folder of the Allplan library now contains the selected profiles as symbols in the Nemetschek Profile Catalog  --> Profile library  folders. You can manage and place these symbols as usual. Installation, Basics Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults 193  Using smart symbols What are smart symbols? A smart symbol is an intelligent symbol whose appearance changes dynamically with the reference scale and view. A smart symbol is composed of several display foils. One foil might contain a 2D representation of an element, while another might include the same element in 3D. Yet another foil can contain a simple representation of the element at 1:100, while another could show a complex representation of the element at 1:10. A smart symbol can have a very simple or very complex structure.  (A)  At a scale of 1:200 (B)  At a scale of 1:100 (C)  Isometric view 194 Using smart symbols Allplan 2020  Smart symbol properties • You can save a smart symbol as a smart symbol file (extension .nmk) to a folder in the library or to any folder. • Smart symbols take up less space. Once you have placed a smart symbol, all the other instances of the smart symbol simply reference the first instance. This means that, regardless of how many times you actually place a smart symbol, only the hard-drive space for a single instance is required (as opposed to symbols or SmartParts). • If you use  Modify Smart Symbol  to modify an instance of a smart symbol, Allplan will automatically modify all the instances of the smart symbol in the same document. • After you have placed a smart symbol, it no longer references the smart symbol stored in the library. This means that overwriting a smart symbol in the library with another smart symbol will not affect the instances of the original that have already been placed. You can use  Update Smart Symbols Placed from Library  to update placed instances of the smart symbol. • With smart symbols, you can display design alternatives quickly and easily, as you can replace all instances or selected instances of a smart symbol in a single step. • In conjunction with the tools in the Attributes  area (Actionbar), smart symbols can be assigned attributes (for example, item number, price) for subsequent analyses in reports. Installation, Basics Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults 195  Components of a smart symbol A smart symbol consists of two- and three-dimensional design entities. Allplan uses the definition and assignment of the individual foils to reassemble the smart symbol at different scales and display modes. The exact position of the foils is preserved, even when you resize a smart symbol. This is made possible by a reference point and so-called resizing points. When you design a smart symbol, you can define areas of the design entity as being dynamic (resizable) or static. A good example is a window frame whose sections remain constant - as opposed to the glass surface whose height and width must be variable.  (A) 3D view (B) 2D view for a scale range of 1:1 to 1:99; this view consists of two foils, because the profiles remain constant while the glass surface needs to be variable. (C) 2D view for a scale range of 1:100 to 1:500 196 Using smart symbols Allplan 2020  General approach for defining smart symbols Follow these steps to define a smart symbol:  • Draw all the elements that are to make up the smart symbol. If the smart symbol is to consist of several congruent foils for different reference scales or views, place the elements that belong together beside or below each other in the workspace; this will make it easier for you to select foils and place reference points.  • Click   Smart Symbol  (Actionbar  - Architecture  role - User -Defined Objects  task - Smart Symbols  task area) and specify the folder where you want to save the smart symbol. Or • Open the Library  palette, go to the folder where you want to save the new smart symbol, point to   Insert element  and click  New smart symbol . • Define the Smart symbol name . • Define the general smart symbol properties in the Attributes  area. • Click Define new foil  and select the elements to be placed on the first smart symbol foil. Specify the reference point and define the parameters of the first foil.  (A) Foil 1 Installation, Basics Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults 197  • Define the other foils. Every area that is subject to a separate resizing definition gets its own foil.  (B) Foil 2 (C) Foil 3 • Define the attributes (min-max box) in the Smart Symbol Defin ition  area. • Click OK to confirm and save the smart symbol. Select smart symbols  in the Library  palette and place the smart symbols in the workspace.   Using SmartParts What are SmartParts? A SmartPart is a parametric Allplan CAD object that acts according to its own logic, which is independent of the CAD system. By using simple, parametric descriptions, you can turn complex geometries of basic elements into new, independent and intelligent objects. These objects are worked out in great detail, including all Allplan resources that are available by default (line, pen, color, layer, and so on). To model SmartParts, you can use all general options. For example, you can join SmartParts, slice them or subtract them from each other. However, you need to define these options in the relevant objects beforehand. Depending on the scripting method used, the objects contain 2D and 3D information. 198 Using SmartParts Allplan 2020  The SmartPart objects and tools are integrated in Allplan. You can find them in the Architecture , Engineering , Draft  and Bridge Construction  roles - User -Defined Objects  task. For example, you can use the   Insert SmartPart  tool to open the dialog box for selecting a SmartPart file. You can also find the appropriate modification options on the shortcut menu of the SmartParts.   Using SmartParts SmartParts are intelligent objects, because they know their parameter values - the object properties. Parametric information is controlled by a script, which is attached directly to the object. You can edit SmartParts by using handles (graphical modification) or a dialog box (alphanumeric modification). These two tools can be selected separately on the SmartPart shortcut menu. You can also use handles and dialog box in combination. Allplan displays any changes you make to an object in real time. Of course, you can save the changes. Installation, Basics Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults 199  Selecting and placing SmartParts You can select SmartParts in one of the following ways:  • Open the SmartParts  library in the Library  palette. Select one of the Allplan SmartParts and place it in the workspace.  • Click   Insert SmartPart , select an existing SmartPart file in SMT format and place the SmartPart in the workspace. • Download a SmartPart from Allplan Connect\\'s Content (http://connect.allplan.com) area. Save the SmartPart and place it in the workspace by using drag-and-drop editing. 200 Using SmartParts Allplan 2020  Creating your own SmartParts If a required object is not available as a SmartPart, you can use Allplan SmartPart script to define your own object. With Allplan\\'s easy-to-learn script language, you can create customized designs of entire components for setting up your own office standard. It is also possible to insert existing objects as resources. SmartPart Script opens up a wide range of new uses: for example, for architectural objects such as roof elements, for site facilities such as containers and cranes or for engineering structures such as retaining walls, bridge piers, settling pools or wind turbines. To access the tools for creating SmartParts such as SmartPart Editor , which you can use to define your own SmartParts, open the Tools  menu, click Customize...  and select the Additional tools with icons  category.  Create SmartPart  opens the SmartPart Editor  dialog box, where you can define SmartParts by means of scripts. Use the tabs to define the components that make up a SmartPart (object content). You can find more information about the SmartParts Script Language (http://help.allplan.com/Allplan/2017-0/0000/SmartPartsScriptReference/index.htm#73528.htm) in the Allplan Help; see Programming interfaces .  Parameters tab for defining parameters and variables Installation, Basics Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults 201   SmartPart technology for modeling objects The Architecture  role - Elements  task provides tools that are based on the SmartPart technology. You can use these tools to model objects: • You can use   Window SmartPart  to create SmartParts for window openings and window sills. • You can use   Door SmartPart  to create SmartParts for door openings and doors. • You can use   Shading Smar tPart  to create SmartParts for shading elements (roller shutters, sliding shutters, folding shutters and blinds). • You can use   Domed Roof -Light SmartPart  to create SmartParts for domed roof-lights. • You can use   Skylight SmartPart  to create SmartParts for rectangular skylights. You define parameters for SmartParts in palettes. Parametric information is controlled by a script, which is attached directly to the object. You can place these SmartParts in openings. They adapt to the outline of the relevant opening. Allplan displays the SmartPart you are modeling in real time. You can save the finished SmartPart as an smv file by using the   Save as a favorite  tool. You can also save the SmartPart in a folder of the Library  palette. 202 Using PythonParts Allplan 2020  Using PythonParts What are PythonParts? PythonParts are parametric objects based on the Python scripting language. Allplan comes with the Python API programming interface. By using Python scripts, you can access Allplan features, thus adding new functions and objects to Allplan. If you want, you can even include reinforcement in these objects. PythonParts have their own workflow and user interface with property palettes and handles. You can change a finished PythonPart with just a few clicks. Apart from creating parametric objects and scripts, you can also automate repeating steps so that you do not need to enter everything from scratch. This increases productivity, prevents planning errors and supports the BIM approach.  Placing a PythonPart To place a PythonPart  1 Open the Library  palette (on page 41).  If you want to see only PythonParts , click   Filter  and hide Symbols , Smart symbols  and SmartParts . 2 Double-click the preview or drag the symbol into the workspace. 3 Click in the workspace to place the PythonPart. You can use the palette or handles to change the properties of PythonParts.  If the Format Properties  are not defined in the PythonPart itself, Allplan uses the settings defined in the Properties  palette. 4 Select the Esc key to finish.  You can find more information on the Python programming interface (http://pythonparts.allplan.com/) on the internet. Installation, Basics Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults 203  Allplan Visual Scripting Allplan Visual Scripting is an application within Allplan. By using Allplan Visual Scripting, you can generate many new parametric shapes and objects and fully automate workflows. To start this application, use  Allplan Visual Scripting  (User -Defined Objects  task - Visual Scripting  task area). You do not need to know how to program if you want to work with Allplan Visual Scripting. All you have to do is visually combine predefined code blocks, which are known as nodes. This results in a script. After running the script, Allplan Visual Scripting calculates the algorithm and creates configurable and reusable objects in Allplan or, depending on the script, runs the workflow defined. Allplan Visual Scripting starts in its own window, which you can resize or move as you need. You can also move this window to another monitor; so you have even more workspace. Allplan stays open in the background. The Allplan Visual Scripting window consists of a toolbar, a library with predefined nodes, and the workspace where you can create scripts. To get more information, start Allplan Visual Scripting and click  Help  - Getting started  on the toolbar. 204 Paths Allplan 2020  Paths When saving or retrieving favorites or standard components, the system will open a dialog box and prompt you to specify a path for the files in question. You take a similar approach when saving and retrieving symbols and smart symbols. You start by going to the corresponding folder in the Library  palette. The distinction between the office , private  and project  paths is particularly important in a network environment. However, you can also structure your data if you are using a standalone version. Installation, Basics Working efficiently thanks to libraries and defaults 205   Path  Meaning  Default The files in this folder come with Allplan. You cannot edit or save data in this folder. Office The files in this folder are available to all users on the network. By using an office standard, you ensure that the plans in your office have a uniform appearance. The office standard can only be modified by the system administrator. Project The files in this folder are only available in one specific project. Private The files in this folder are only available to one specific user. External path The files in this path are for backing up or exchanging data. Note: You can use the Save to  option in the Options - Desktop environment - Save/load  area to define which Allplan file type is saved to which folder. These folders are preset in the \"Save\" dialog box of the relevant file type. However, you can change the folders at any time.   Using and importing content Allplan 2020 takes much preparatory work away from architects and engineers. Using layout content, you can enhance your layouts and animations. Layout content offers a wide range of options - from symbols and symbol catalogs of any kind to textures and smart symbols to SmartParts. To make sure that you can proceed quickly and efficiently, everything is available on the Internet - from the essentials to exclusive Serviceplus content. Architects and engineers can look for predefined, building-specific online data and information, download and install it. 206 Using and importing content Allplan 2020  Using the Connect palette, you can register for and directly log on to Allplan Connect (http://connect.allplan.com) and thus use the extensive selection of objects provided. You can download and install content or simply drag individual objects into the workspace.   How to import Allplan Connect (http://connect.allplan.com) and the Help provide information on how to import Content  data. Installation, Basics Using OLE objects 207  Using OLE objects Using OLE objects By means of the OLE technology, you can link and embed objects and thus exchange information between different applications. Data from a source document (for example, Microsoft® Word) is associated with or embedded in an Allplan document. When you select the embedded data, the original application opens, and you can edit the data in the source document. The following object types can be embedded in Allplan (depending on the applications you have installed):  • Excel files (.xls, xlsx) • Word files (.doc, .docx) • RTF files (.rtf) • PowerPoint files (.ppt, pptx) • Bitmaps (for example, .bmp, .jpg) The linked program must be an OLE server program (such as many Microsoft Office programs). Otherwise, the linked program cannot provide OLE objects. 208 Linking and embedding OLE objects Allplan 2020  Linking and embedding OLE objects You can insert OLE objects in Allplan in two ways. The difference lies in the way Allplan saves the objects: Linking objects When objects are linked with Allplan, the Allplan document is linked with the object in question. When the object changes, you can manually update the link in Allplan. Double-clicking the linked object in Allplan opens it in its original application and you can edit it as usual. You must not change the paths to the source document and to the original application. When you rename either one, you must create the link again. Embedding objects When objects are embedded in Allplan, a copy of the source document is placed in the Allplan document. After you have inserted this copy, it is no longer linked to the source document. In other words, the program cannot update the Allplan document to reflect any changes you make to the source document. Embedded objects can be edited either in Allplan or in their original application; but any changes you make to the object have no effect on the source document. Installation, Basics Using OLE objects 209  Transparency of OLE objects The background of OLE objects can only be transparent or not transparent; the default setting is transparent. Transparent background means that you can see the Allplan background color instead of the background color of the OLE object. Therefore, turn off transparency when you use a black background in Allplan and the OLE object you have embedded is a Word document with black text, for example.   Editing OLE objects Double-clicking an OLE object opens it in its original application and you can edit it as usual. You can also open and edit objects linked with Allplan directly in the original application and then update them in Allplan. All you have to do is double-click these objects and edit them. Just double-click these objects and edit them. Embedded objects can be edited either in Allplan or in their original application; but any changes you make to the object have no effect on the source document. You can use Allplan tools such as Copy, Move, and so on to edit OLE objects. To change the size of OLE objects, use the  Resize  tool. 210 Restrictions when using OLE objects in Allplan Allplan 2020  Restrictions when using OLE objects in Allplan There are some issues to bear in mind when using OLE objects in the current Allplan version:  • If you want to change the size of an OLE object, you must use   Resize . • Linked OLE objects cannot be updated automatically; you must do this manually. • OLE objects are only printed with Windows drivers. You cannot use Allplan vector drivers. Installation, Basics Using XRefs 211  Using XRefs Using XRefs You can place a document (drawing file or NDW file) as an XRef in a document as often as you need. The advantage is that you do not have to enter the same elements again and again. For example, think of the furniture of hotel rooms. Just create the elements in another document and insert this document as an XRef as often as you like. In the case of changes, you must change the original data only once - all associated XRefs will adapt dynamically. You can insert XRefs at any scale and angle. But you cannot insert empty documents as XRefs. You can place XRefs as normal XRefs or as advanced XRefs. For more information, see Comparison between normal and advanced XRefs in the Allplan Help. The XRef size matches the element size in the document. If the size changes later, you can update the XRef by selecting Update All XRefs  on the shortcut menu. If you want, you can clip an XRef later. You cannot do this while placing the XRef. In   Show/Hide , you can turn XRefs and XRef borders on and off. Regardless of this setting,   Area detection  always takes the XRef border into account. To avoid this, you can place the XRef on a separate layer and hide this layer. Elements in advanced XRefs will still be taken into account. XRefs are always placed on the current layer. However, the individual elements of an XRef retain their layers. When you change the status of a layer, you must update the screen contents to apply the change to elements within XRefs. You cannot create nested XRefs (in other words, documents including XRefs cannot be inserted as XRefs again). If a document, which has been inserted as an XRef, no longer exists, the border and reference remain unchanged, and the file name of the associated document is visible in the border. 212 Editing XRefs Allplan 2020  Editing XRefs You can edit XRefs with the following Allplan tools: Delete , Copy , Move  and Rotate . You can use   Modify Format Properties  to change the format properties of XRefs (for example, layers). Other Allplan tools cannot be applied to XRefs. The scale and the angle at which an XRef is inserted can be modified later. You can also change the clip region later. Click   to replace the document. The program replaces the document so that the midpoints of the two min-max boxes are identical. XRefs can be modified and edited as a single entity only; you cannot modify individual elements of an XRef. You can use Edit Reference Drawing File  on the shortcut menu of an XRef to open the drawing file which has been inserted as an XRef.  The shortcut menu only provides this tool if the Show fileset structure  option is active in the   Settings  of the Open on a project -specific basis: drawing files from f ileset/building structure  dialog box. After running this tool, you can switch to the fileset structure for further editing. Changing the display sequence of XRefs always affects the entire contents of the XRef file. Installation, Basics Using XRefs 213  Comparison between normal and advanced XRefs The following table shows a comparison between normal and advanced XRefs. Feature  Advanced  Normal  Considered by area detection x - Point snap restricted (end points only) - x Animation, hidden-line image, perspective view x - Included in analyses (does not apply to engineering elements!) x - Dimension text and size of text adjusted when XRef is resized x - Clipping - x Detailing windows - x Correcting text direction x - Default planes from source, destination x - Note : When you insert advanced XRefs, the required hard-drive space increases by the data volume of the document contained in the XRef, as the data is also stored in the memory. Normal XRefs do not increase the data volume. 214 Restrictions when using normal XRefs in Allplan Allplan 2020  Restrictions when using normal XRefs in Allplan There are some issues to bear in mind when using normal XRefs in Allplan:  • Point snap : Only end points are snapped. • Reports , legends : Elements are not analyzed by reports and legends. • Animation : Elements are not visible in animations. • Element interaction : Architectural elements within an XRef and architectural elements in the document do not interact. • Hidden -line image : Normal XRefs are not visible in hidden-line images. • Correct text direction : The text direction is not corrected (Options - Text). Note : These restrictions do not affect advanced XRefs. For more information, see Comparison between normal and advanced XRefs in the Allplan Help. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 215  Structuring and managing data Structuring and managing data You can use projects and documents to manage data in Allplan. The options that are actually available to you depend on the license you have purchased. The following table helps you determine when to use which method.   Open on a project -specific basis  Open, save NDW file  Working with Allplan’s project structure as usual • Opening Allplan documents across projects  • Opening Allplan documents saved to CD or memory stick  • Designing across projects  • Sending drawing files by email 216 Structuring and managing data Allplan 2020  Working with projects and documents - comparison The table below compares the tools for handling files provided by the two variants. When working with projects, you use drawing files and NDW files. When working with documents, you use NDW files and NPL files.

Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 217  Overview of projects, building structure, drawing files and layouts A project is an organizational unit. When you work in Allplan in a project-based manner, a new project is created for each construction project. Technically, a project is a folder; metaphorically speaking, it is a drawer containing the drawing files. An unnamed private project  for practice and testing is available to each user. You use the building structure to organize the data of a project. This way, you use hierarchical levels to logically structure a building, thus forming the basis for a Building Information Model (BIM). Each structural level gets drawing files and default planes defining the height of the components belonging to the structural level in question. You can derive and create sections, views and reports directly from the building structure.  In addition, you can assemble up to 128 drawing files in a fileset; a project can contain up to 1,000 filesets. A fileset can be placed in a layout with a single command.  The actual design and data creation process happens in drawing files. These are the equivalent of the transparencies used in conventional building design. Drawing files can be used to give projects a structure. In IT terms, a drawing file is a conventional file stored on your hard disk. You can display and edit up to 128 drawing files at once - in other words, you can have several files open simultaneously. A project can contain up to 9999 drawing files. When working without layers, the individual building elements (such as walls, stairs, labeling, etc.) are drawn on different drawing files and superimposed like transparencies. Layers provide an additional means of applying a structure - within documents. They apply to all the drawing files in a project. Design entities and components can automatically be assigned to the correct layer. Layers can be set so that they are not visible to the user. 218 Working with projects Allplan 2020  A layout is the unit you send to the printer. As opposed to design using a conventional drafting board, the scope of the layout does not have to be defined in advance. Generally, you leave the layout (which involves arranging and laying out drawing files or filesets) until you’re finished with the design. Each project can contain up to 9,999 layouts. To find out how to handle projects, filesets, drawing files, layers and layouts, see \"Structuring and managing data (on page 215)\".   Working with projects Using project templates A project template is a project you can select as a template when you create a new project. Consequently, the new project is an identical copy of the project template selected. You can save any project as a project template. Project templates are in the office folder (\\\\Std\\\\ProjectTemplates) or in the default folder (\\\\Etc\\\\ProjectTemplates). If the original project is a country-specific project, Allplan saves the project templates in the appropriate country-specific folder, for example \\\\Etc.eng or \\\\Std.eng. You can use ProjectPilot to delete or rename project templates in the office folder. To save a project as a project template  • Start ProjectPilot and copy the project by dragging it to the Office \\\\Project templates folder . Or: Click   New Project, Open Project...  , open the shortcut menu of the project and click Copy to project templates . Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 219  Working with drawing files Open on a project-specific basis: drawing files from fileset/building structure You can use this tool to open a dialog box where you can change the status of drawing files and create fileset structures and building structures, for example. The dialog box ha s two tabs:  • Building structure  tab: This is where you create and modify the building structure, assign drawing files to structural levels and select active, edit and reference drawing files by changing the drawing file status. For more information see Working with the building structure (see \"Using the building structure\" on page 224). • Fileset structure  tab: This is where you create, modify and delete filesets, assign drawing files to filesets and select active, edit and reference drawing files by changing the drawing file status. For more information see Working with the fileset structure.  Tip: To check the current drawing file status: Unless you change the drawing file status, you can close the dialog box selecting the Esc key. 220 Working with drawing files Allplan 2020  Understanding drawing files In Allplan, the actual design and data creation happens in drawing files. These are the equivalent of the transparencies used in conventional building design. Drawing files can be used to give projects a structure. In IT terms, a drawing file is a conventional file stored on your hard drive. You can display and edit up to 128 drawing files at once - in other words, you can have several files open simultaneously. A project can contain up to 9999 drawing files. Without layers, the individual building elements (such as walls, stairs, labeling) are drawn in different drawing files and superimposed like transparencies.  To edit the drawing files, you must open them. You can do this in the Open on a project -specific basis: drawing files fr om fileset/building structure  dialog box. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 221  Drawing file status With the drawing file status, you define the drawing file on which you draw and which drawing files are visible and can be modified. The following illustration shows the different drawing file statuses. You can find an explanation in the table.   Number   Drawing file  status  Comment   1 Current or active The current or active drawing file is the one in which you draw. There must always be one current or active drawing file. 2 Open in edit mode Elements in drawing files open in edit mode are visible and can be modified. Up to 128 drawing files can be open simultaneously (regardless of whether they are current, in edit mode or in reference mode). 3 Open in reference mode Elements in drawing files open in reference mode are visible, but they cannot be modified. You can configure the program to use the same color for all elements in reference drawing files. To do this, select the  Options , click Desktop environment  and open the Display  page. You cannot open empty drawing files in reference mode. 4 Not selected Elements in these drawing files are not visible. 5 Empty Empty drawing files have no data type icon. 6 Assigned temporarily The drawing file is assigned temporarily to the fileset. Allplan clears this assignment as soon as you switch to a different fileset. 222 Working with drawing files Allplan 2020  7 Open in reference mode The drawing file has been opened by another user in the workgroup environment. 8 Open in reference mode The drawing file has been opened by another user in the workgroup environment; the color red indicates that the drawing file has changed. You can apply the changes by selecting Update drawing file  on the shortcut menu. In the   Options  - Desktop environment  page, you can configure the program to inform you of changes in reference drawing files. 9 Linked drawing file The drawing file contains model data or views and sections linked with other drawing files. Allplan links drawing files when you create views and sections with the tools in the Reinforcement Views  task area. You can use the shortcut menu to list all reference drawing files of the current drawing file or open its reference drawing files in edit or reference mode. 10 Views and sections created automatically The drawing file contains views and sections that you created by using the shortcut menu in the “Derived from building structure” area or views and sections that you created with the tools in the Sections  task area of which the results were saved in this drawing file. These views and sections usually refer to other drawing files. Allplan considers the model data in these drawing files. 11 Update locked By using the shortcut menu in the \"Derived from building structure\" area, you can lock the update of drawing files with views and sections created with the Update automatically  option not being selected. Allplan cannot update the result until the drawing file is unlocked or the Update automatically  option is selected. After having confirmed a prompt, you can create a new view or section in the drawing file. 12 Views and sections placed manually The drawing file contains views and sections created with the tools in the Sections  task area. These views and sections can refer to other drawing files. Allplan considers the model data in these drawing files. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 223  Information on the active drawing file To get information on the active document, right-click in the workspace and choose Properties  on the shortcut menu. An information box with all the important information about the file opens.  Information  Meaning  Memory allocation This shows how much of the memory reserved for a file has already been allocated (as a percentage). Background information: A certain amount of memory is reserved for files. Document This shows the number of the current file. You can also find this number on the title bar of the Allplan window. Document type This shows the file type, which corresponds to the data type icon on the status bar. Maximum size This shows the maximum amount of memory available for the file in kilobytes. Min. values, max. values This shows the minimum and maximum coordinates in the file. 224 Using the building structure Allplan 2020  Using the building structure What is the building structure? The building structure provides a customizable and flexible way of structuring, organizing and using documents (=drawing files) in Allplan (think of the Building Information Model). You can use the building structure to logically structure a building in several hierarchical levels. Analyses, such as sections, views and reports, can be derived directly from the building structure. Allplan comes with several predefined building structures. The plane model is directly associated with the building structure. The building structure consists of a number of hierarchically structured levels to which you can assign drawing files. You can then assign a pair of default planes to each structural level. All the drawing files belonging to a structural level can use the default planes assigned to this structural level. Consequently, the associated drawing files adapt automatically when you change the height settings of a structural level. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 225  Advantages of the building structure Working with the building structure has significant advantages:  • The building structure comes with an integrated plane model you can use to manage default planes and roof planes for an entire project. These planes can be assigned directly to drawing files. • Data can be copied in an easy and comfortable manner (for example, create new stories or design alternatives). • You can generate views, sections and reports quickly and easily. • Source drawing files and destination drawing files are saved automatically; you do not need to give any thought to which drawing files should be selected. • Simplified data exchange via IFC. • Structuring data based on the topological structure of a building reflects the approach of designers. 226 Using the building structure Allplan 2020  Example of a building structure Example of a building structure (taken from the Detached house  example that comes with Allplan) Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 227  Creating a building structure You can create a building structure in several ways:  • You can create the building structure by using floor manager. If you use this method, you can create the building structure and the objects derived from the building structure in one go. At the same time, you can assign height settings to the structural levels. • You can configure the program to create the building structure automatically the first time you open the Building structure  tab. If you use this method, you can select a building structure that comes with Allplan. • You can create the building structure by using the building structure wizard.  Using structural levels to apply a logical structure to a building By means of structural levels, you can apply a logical structure to a building. You can assign one or more drawing files to each structural level. There are two different types of structural levels:  • Predefined structural levels : Predefined structural levels can only be used in their hierarchical sequence. For example, a structure cannot be subordinate to a building. However, structural levels can be left out (for example, a building can be subordinate to a project). The following five predefined structural levels are available (in this hierarchy): - Site - Structure - Building - Story - Substory • Any structural levels : in addition, you can use custom structural levels, which you can insert anywhere in the building structure. Click Restrictions of building structure  on the shortcut menu of a project to specify which structural levels can be used in the building structure and which structural levels can be assigned drawing files. 228 Using the building structure Allplan 2020  For example, you can specify that only IFC-compliant structural levels can be used.  Restrictions of building structure You can restrict the use of structural levels and the option to assign drawing files to a structural level. This way, you can limit the structures to IFC-compliant structures. You can define restrictions by clicking Restrictions of building structure  on the shortcut menu of a project. If restrictions you define later are inconsistent with the existing structural levels and drawing files, you first need to eliminate these inconsistencies and remove the structural levels and drawing file assignments that are no longer allowed.  In the dialog box, a red cross indicates invalid structural levels and drawing file assignments.   Building structure and fileset structure You can use the building structure and the fileset structure in parallel. The drawing file status can be selected both in the fileset structure and in the building structure; these two settings are independent of each other. Which drawing files are selected depends on the tab that is active when you close the dialog box. However, there is one important difference: A drawing file can only be assigned once to a structural level in the building structure. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 229  Selecting structural levels You can select structural levels by clicking the relevant check box. The program takes into account the drawing file status when the corresponding structural level is selected.       Structural level is selected  Structural level is not selected  Only subordinate structural levels are selected  • Clicking a check box selects the relevant structural level and all subordinate levels. • Clicking a check box while selecting and holding the Ctrl key selects this structural level only; subordinate levels are not included. • If subordinate structural levels are selected, a fill is applied to the check box of the superordinate structural level. 230 Using the building structure Allplan 2020  Displaying the height settings of default planes The dialog box displays the height settings of the lower and upper default planes as follows:   • A: The structural level shows the height settings of the associated default planes. • B: You can see nothing when a drawing file adopts the height settings of the default planes from the superordinate structural level. • C: The values are blue when the height settings of the default planes in a drawing file differ from the height settings assigned to the superordinate structural level. • D: You can see \"-\" when a drawing file does not adopt its default planes from the plane model. • E: You can see \"?\" when the default planes assigned to the drawing file are not available (for example, when you delete the planes from the plane model later). When you hover over a height, the ToolTip shows the name of the plane model, the name of the pair of planes and the name of the default plane.

You manage default planes, roofscapes, offset planes and reference surfaces in a plane model. A plane model contains pairs of default planes. Each pair of planes has a name. The same is true for the lower and upper default planes. The pairs of reference planes in a plane model are equivalent to the stories of a building. You can assign them to the structural levels of the building structure or to individual drawing files. A project can contain several discrete plane models. You can change the height settings of the default planes in the plane model. Any changes made to the height settings are immediately reflected in the drawing files to which you have assigned a default plane from the building model. A plane model must not contain pairs of planes with overlapping height settings with the exception of the pair of planes that defines the minimum and maximum height of the building. You can assign the height settings of a pair of planes to a drawing file or structural level of the building structure. However, you can also use the lower and upper default planes from different pairs of planes. Thus, you can create components across several floors (for example, chimneys). You can also assign default planes that are not associated with the plane model to drawing files. You can even select a custom height for the lower default plane and adopt the upper default plane from a plane model. You can also use plane models without a building structure. In the  Options , Plane s page, you can configure the program to display planes in elevation and isometric views. In the   Options  - Desktop environment  - Animation  page, you can configure the program to display planes in viewports with the Animation  view type. Plane models are saved as XML files in the project-specific \\\\prj\\\\bim folder. 236 Using the building structure Allplan 2020  Example of a plane model Example of a plane model (taken from the Detached house  example that comes with Allplan) Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 237  Plane model in the Planes palette The Planes  palette (on page 53) also displays the current plane model:  While creating components, you can keep track of the default planes and all other objects on which the heights of the components can be based. With   Modification mode on , you can change the plane model at any time without opening the building structure. 238 Working with layers Allplan 2020  Working with layers Understanding layers Layers provide an additional means of structuring design entities within drawing files. You can display exactly the information you need just by turning the relevant layers on and off. This way, you can proceed quickly, as you can see better what you are doing. You can use layers to define the format properties of elements. Layers are important organizational elements. Their importance increases the more people are involved in a project and the more a CAD system is used for specialist design processes. Layers do not replace drawing files. Rather, they complement them.^   Advantages of data organization with layers With large projects in particular, orga nizing data with layers has significant advantages:  • Associative elements - such as wall dimensions or sill elevation labels - are in the same drawing file and yet can still be hidden from view. • So that components interact, the components in question must be in the same drawing file. This is also the case for certain analyses. With layers, you can meet these requirements easily. • Easier to assemble layouts thanks to print sets. Print sets are user-defined compilations of layers, which are very useful for editing and assembling layouts. When assembling a layout, you can choose to display only the elements in a specific print set - switching between 1:50 and 1:100 is thus no problem. • Exporting drawing files to DXF/DWG layers is easier, because you can assign each layer in a drawing file to a different DXF/DWG layer When importing DXF/DWG files, the DXF/DWG layer structure can be automatically integrated in the layer hierarchy. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 239  • It is often faster to modify the layer of an element than to modify the drawing file of an element. • If a layer is missing from the layer structure, you can create it quickly and use it in all the drawing files of the project. • A project can contain more layers (approximately 65,000) than drawing files (9,999). With layers, you can distinguish more precisely between the individual design entities. • You can display and edit 65000 layers at once whereas the number of drawing files that you can have open simultaneously is 128. • You can show and hide layers very quickly (for example, by means of print sets, layer favorites, the Layers  palette or the Objects  palette - Sort by layer  criterion). • You can change the format properties of a layer later. All the elements of this layer that were drawn with the From layer, line style  setting will adapt automatically. So, you do not need to modify the elements separately. • You can copy format properties including layers by double-clicking with the right mouse button. This method also works with wizards. Similarly, you can use  Copy Format  to quickly copy the format properties of an element and apply them to other elements.  Disadvantages of data organization with layers Besides the numerous advantages, organizing data with layers also has two disadvantages:  • Layers involve some managing work, at least in the beginning. • If your entire data organization is based on layers, the data is in one drawing file (that is, in one file). This means that only one user at a time can access the data. You must spread the data over different drawing files so hat several users can work and access the data at the same time. 240 Working with layers Allplan 2020  Relationship between layers and drawing files The use of layers doesn\\'t mean that drawing files don\\'t play a role when it comes to organizing your data. With large project in particular, a combination of both is essential. With the same structural depth, the number of drawing files required is far less when working with layers. The number of drawing files you need not only depends on the size of the project, but also on your hardware. Modern, fast computers with a lot of memory can handle a lot more data per drawing file without this leading to a noticeable downturn in performance. The interplay between layers and drawing files depends on the following factors:  • The size of the project and the number of designers involved at any one time.  If several designers are working on one floor, create one drawing file per area of responsibility (East Wing, Central Unit, West Wing, for example.) • Simultaneous involvement of specialist designers on the project. Always use separate drawing files for specialist designs to facilitate concurrent activity.  Defining the current layer When created, each element is given the current layer. The layer which is used as the current layer is governed by the following settings: • When you activate a tool (for example, line) for the first time, a specific layer is automatically selected as the current layer (if the Auto -select layer with tool  option is selected in the Layer  dialog box). The layer in question depends on which tool you activate. If the Auto -select layer with tool  option is not selected, the program automatically uses the layer you selected last. • The Layers  palette shows the current layer. You can change the layer status with just one click.  You can display the entire layer hierarchy, the layers assigned to the currently selected tool or the layers used in open documents. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 241  To do this, you can use the extensive shortcut menu of the Layers  palette. • The Objects  palette - Sort by layer  criterion also shows the current layer. You can change the layer status by clicking the icon indicating the layer status. You can see all the layers in the documents loaded. The tree structure lists all layers with their elements sorted by element group. • If a tool (for example, Line) is active, you can use the Properties  palette to define a different layer as the current one. This layer will then automatically be used as the current layer the next time you activate the tool. • When you save components as styles or favorite files, the program also saves the current layer. When you retrieve these components later, the layer saved automatically becomes the current layer. • Normally, openings like recesses in walls and slabs or window and door openings get the same layer as the element into which they are inserted. Click the Special  button in the   Options - Components and architecture - Miscellaneous area  to specify whether these openings can be assigned separate, independent layers. • As walls can consist of multiple construction layers and each layer can have different format properties, you can define the layer for each of the construction layers in a wall or upstand directly in the Properties  dialog box (you usually make these settings in the Properties  palette). 242 Working with layers Allplan 2020  Using privilege sets With privilege sets, you can control users\\' access to layers. You should assign privilege sets if several people work on the same project. With workgroup manager, you can assign individual users to one or more privilege sets. As a result, these users can see or edit only the layers that are associated with the relevant privilege set. Privilege sets can do more than just control who accesses which layers. They simplify your whole work, as you can define privilege sets with a selection of layers that are to be available while drawing. After installation, the ALLPLAN  privilege set is preset. This privilege set has read/write permissions for all layers. Consequently, all users can see and modify all data.  Using print sets A print set is a set of layers that you can select when compiling and arranging layouts. You can also use print sets to control which layers are visible or hidden. Only the elements whose layers are included in the selected print set are visible in the layout. For example, you can select a print set for working drawings so that only the data that is relevant to a working drawing appears in the final printout. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 243  Layer dialog box Use the Layer  dialog box to carry out all the required layer administration tasks in Allplan. As a normal user, you can show and hide layers and select the current layer. As the administrator or as a user with administrator privileges, you can create and manage print sets and privilege sets, assign format properties to layers and create and modify layer structures. \\uf0dc When you work with workgroup manager in a network environment, you must be signed in as the administrator. Otherwise, you cannot change the settings on the Print set , Privi lege set , Format definition  and Layer structures  tabs. 244 Working with layers Allplan 2020  Setting layer visibility in drawing files You can make layers visible or invisible, thus showing or hiding the corresponding elements. Thus, you can quickly hide the elements you don\\'t need during the current design phase, selectively modify elements on the visible layers, check your plan and see whether all the elements are assigned to the correct layer. For example, you might choose to hide the slab layer and then view the spatial arrangement of the building as a hidden-line image in perspective view.    Note : Right-click an element and, on the shortcut menu, select   Modify Layer Status  and then   Isolate layer - set all other layers to hidden  to hide all the layers except the layer of the element clicked. If you often need the same combination of visible and hidden layers (for dimensioning or labeling at certain scales, for example), we recommend that you define what is known as a print set. You can also use this print set when you assemble the layout later, thus making sure that only the visible layers are included in the printout.  Note:  You can choose to Display elements on frozen layers in a fixed color  by selecting this option in the Layer  dialog box. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 245  Managing layers and layer structures The office administrator is usually in charge of managing layers and layer structures. This person defines which layers are used, defines privilege sets and grants access rights. By assigning the other users (architects, engineers and so on) to the privilege sets, the office administrator grants the users access to the layers. When you create a project, you can decide whether you want to use the layer structure of the office standard or a project-specific layer structure. You can name and save layer structures and retrieve these structures later. If you have assigned line styles to layers, these line styles are saved together with the layer structure (with the same file name plus the extension .sty). When importing a layer structure you saved, you can decide whether to import the associated line style file too. 246 Working with layers Allplan 2020  Layer access rights There are different layer access rights. On the one hand, there is the visibility setting which controls whether a layer is visible or hidden. On the other hand, there is the edit setting which controls whether a layer can be edited or not (that is, it is frozen). You can save visibility settings in print sets (see \"Using print sets\" on page 242) and edit settings in privilege sets. The status of a layer is indicated by icons  in the Layer  dialog box (Select Layer/Visibility  tab) and in the Layers  palette: Icon  Access right  Explanation   Current The layer on which you draw.  Modifiable Elements in this layer are visible and can be modified.  Visible, frozen Elements in this layer are visible but cannot be modified.  Hidden, frozen Elements on this layer are not visible and cannot be modified. You can restrict access to layers on the Select Layer/Visibility  tab or in the Layers  palette. For example, you can change the status of layers from Modifiable  to Visible, frozen . The Objects  palette - Sort by layer  criterion shows the layers in the loaded documents. The tree structure lists all layers with their elements sorted by element group. When you point to the icon indicating the layer status in the list, Allplan opens a flyout menu where you can change the status of the layer. Here, too, you can change access to layers. You can switch between  Current ,   Modifiable ,   Visible, frozen  and  Hidden, frozen . Layer access rights also depend on the privilege set to which a user belongs. Therefore, you cannot assign a higher status to layers (for example, switch hidden layers to modifiable) when you belong to a privilege set that is not granted full access rights to the relevant layers. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 247  Defining format properties based on layers In the Layer  dialog box, you can specify that an element is to automatically assume the properties of the layer on which the element is drawn. This inv olves two steps:  • Open the Format Definition  tab and select one of the three options for matching the format properties of layers. This setting applies to the current project. It applies to all new elements and is valid until you explicitly change it. When you work with workgroup manager in a network environment, you must be signed in as the administrator. Otherwise, you cannot make any settings in this area.  • Switch to the Select Layer/Visibility  tab and specify the format properties (pen thickness, line type and line color) the program is to take from the layer. 248 Managing data with ProjectPilot Allplan 2020  Managing data with ProjectPilot What is ProjectPilot? You use ProjectPilot  to create and structure projects in a simple and clear manner. ProjectPilot is a powerful data management tool developed specially for the data structure of Allplan. ProjectPilot provides tools for copying, moving, renaming and deleting data (for example, projects, drawing files). If you are already familiar with File Explorer, then you’ll find that working with ProjectPilot is just as easy. You can use the shortcut menu for almost everything. If you find that you need to move or copy files, you can simply drag them to the new folder.  User interface Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 249  Left window (A) The left window shows the projects and folders in a tree structure. The current project is selected and open. Click the plus sign (+) to display the levels in a folder. Click the name of a folder to display its contents in the right window. By double-clicking, you can display the contents of the folder and open it at the same time. Right window (B) The right window shows the folders and documents in the selected node (in the left window). You can sort the documents by clicking the title of a column. Right-click in the background to display the documents as a list or as icons. Preview (C) You can see the currently selected document (drawing file, layout) in the preview. To move the preview, click it with the middle mouse button and drag. Use a selection rectangle to zoom in on an area in the preview. Double-clicking with the middle mouse button restores the preview to its original size. Alternatively, select the * key on the numeric keypad. To display an isometric view: use the number keys on the numeric keypad. Check that the Num Lock key is active as you do so. 250 Managing data with ProjectPilot Allplan 2020  Common approaches in ProjectPilot Finding documents You can search for objects (documents, folders or projects) in ProjectPilot. The program creates a temporary folder - Search results  - in the tree view, displaying the objects found in the document window. To find documents  1 Right-click a folder and select Find  on the shortcut menu. The Define search criteria dialog box opens. 2 Go to Attribute  and select the attribute you want to find. 3 Go to Operator  and select the logical operator. Note : You can only see operators that are appropriate to the selected attribute. 4 Go to Value  and enter the condition that the attribute is to fulfill. 5 Click   Add line . 6 If you want to enter more conditions, define the next condition, specify how the conditions are to be linked and click Add line  again. 7 When you have finished defining criteria, click Find . The program creates a temporary folder - Search results  - in the tree view, displaying the objects found in the document window. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 251  Sorting documents You can sort the documents by clicking the title of a column. Click the column title to sort the documents in ascending order. Click the same column title again to sort the documents in descending order. An arrow indicates which column is being sorted and whether sorting is in ascending or descending order.     Sorted in ascending order (arrow points upward) by drawing file name Sorted in descending order (arrow points downward) by drawing file number 252 Managing data with ProjectPilot Allplan 2020  Selecting documents To edit several documents in a single operation (to copy or move them, for example), you must select them first. The following methods are available for selecting documents:  • To select a single document, click it. • To select a series of non-adjacent documents, select the CTRL key while clicking the documents one after the other.  • To select a range of drawing files, click the first drawing file in the range, then select the SHIFT key while clicking the last drawing file in the range. Alternatively, open a selection rectangle around the documents you want to select. Installation, Basics Structuring and managing data 253   Copying and moving by means of drag-and-drop editing Instead of the shortcut menu, you can also use the drag-and-drop feature to move or copy selected documents. Select the documents, click within the selection and drag. You can tell whether this is possible by the shape of the cursor when the mouse pointer is positioned over the destination.  Cursor  Meaning   Copies  the document to the folder to which point.  Moves  the document to the folder to which you point. Note : To move documents, select and hold the Shift key while dragging the documents.  Links the document with the folder to which you point (for example, when you assign drawing files to a fileset).  The document cannot be placed here.   Working with the shortcut menu You can use the shortcut menu to do almost everything in ProjectPilot. Depending on which element you click, a shortcut menu appropriate to the element opens.    Shortcut menu of a project Shortcut menu of the fileset folder  Tip: You can also use keyboard shortcuts to select documents. For example, you can quickly select all the entries in a list by selecting the first document in the list and then selecting Shift+Ctrl+End. 254 Managing data with ProjectPilot Allplan 2020  Using the preview You can see the selected document in the preview. You can zoom in on the preview, pan the preview and display the preview in isometric view. Click Preview  on the View  menu to specify whether and where to place the preview. • To turn off the preview , point to Preview  on the View  menu and click None . • To zoom in on the preview , open a selection rectangle around the area you want to view in detail. The cursor changes to crosshairs. • To pan the preview , move the view with the middle mouse button. The cursor changes to a hand. Alternatively, use the cursor keys. • To restore the preview to full view , double-click the middle mouse button in the preview area or select the * key on the numeric keypad. • To display an isometric view , use the number keys on the numeric keypad. Check that the Num Lock key and the preview are selected as you do so. Note : The preview is only available with certain documents (drawing files, layouts). Installation, Basics Exchanging data with other programs 255  Exchanging data with other programs DWG, DXF , DGN interfaces Available file types for export and import With the ODX interfaces, you can convert files from and to numerous formats. The following overview shows the file types you can export and import. The file types that are actually available to you depend on the configuration you purchased. The following file types are available:  • AutoCAD files of versions V12, 2000, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2018 in the following formats: .dwg, .dwt, .dxb, .dxf. • MicroStation files (.dgn) • HPGL2 files (import only) • SVG files (export only) • ODX batch files (.ncb). See Using batch files for import and export in the Allplan Help.^   Conversion (overview) This section shows how to convert data. As an example, you will import data. 256 DWG, DXF, DGN interfaces Allplan 2020  To convert files  1 Click   Import  to start the import.  2 Specify the file type and folder with the files you want to convert in the Import  dialog box. 3 Click Open . Allplan starts the automatic assignment.  4 Start the conversion by clicking OK. Note : Click Modify  if you want to check or modify assignments. 5 Finally, check the log file. Installation, Basics Exchanging data with other programs 257  Importing files with large coordinates DXF and DWG files can contain elements with very large coordinates; this is especially true in the case of files with country coordinates. When you check the log file after having imported a file with large coordinates, you will find the following warning: Coordinates exceed 5,000 m.  Large coordinates can cause problems when you edit the imported data in Allplan. Do the following to use the data without problem:  • During import you can use Adjust center of gravity to:   (  Settings  - General Settings  tab) to tell Allplan how to  handle data with large coordinates: - When you select the Off option, the data remain unchanged. - Select the Adjust center of gravity to: Offset  option. This automatically enters an offset in the Project Settings , moving the origin of the file (= center of the min-max box) to the origin of the coordinate system. You cannot use this option when you have already specified an offset in the Project Settings .   Note : Here, offset means that Allplan moves the data during import; the values by which the data is moved will automatically be written to the project. This offset applies to the entire project. An offset changes the coordinates of the drawing files in this project. - Select the Adjust center of gravity to: Origin  option. This moves the center of the data to the origin of the Allplan coordinate system. • During import, you can define an additional offset  in the   Settings . Allplan will use this offset in addition to the offset defined in the Project Settings . Pay attention to the direction of conversion when you enter an offset: - Negative values for import - Positive values for export 258 DWG, DXF, DGN interfaces Allplan 2020  • Import the data. Then, move the data toward the origin by using the   Move  tool in Allplan. • Define offset coordinates in the Project Settings . Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. Important  Using an offset is usually the better solution: • Point coordinates are measured correctly, and they do not change. This is particularly important when you need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). • Allplan automatically considers the offset when you export and import data. • Whenever you move data, you change the coordinates themselves. Use this option only  if you want to work with this data only in your office and you do not need to export the data again (coordinates in site plans are legally binding). If a project with large coordinates is at an advanced stage, Allplan provides another solution that helps you enhance the representation of this data. • Open the  Options  on the Desktop environment  page and select the Optimize working with large coordinates  option. Allplan optimizes the coordinates of the elements internally, restoring the original values each time you save the data, for example.  Adjusting units and lengths During conversion, you can use three parameters to control how the program adjusts the units in the source system to the units in the destination system. Depending on the source system and destination system, you might not be able to change the Unit  and Layout scale  parameters. By using the Resizing factor , however, you can always adjust the units. Installation, Basics Exchanging data with other programs 259  You can define these parameters in the Settings  dialog box in the Coordinates and length parameters  area.  Unit Depending on whether your partner office is using m, cm or mm, they will enter 1.0, 100.0 or 1000.0 when drawing a one-meter line. With the Unit  parameter, you indicate to the program whether the value is to be interpreted as mm, cm, dm and so on. During import : Select the unit with which the file being converted (the source file) was created. During export : Select the unit with which the exported file (the destination file) is to be further edited. Contact your partner office to find out which unit they use in their files. The reason for this is that in the case of coordinate entries and length entries, only the figure (and not the unit) is present in the source file. In DWG/DXF files, the elements can be stored in any unit. Note : In some systems, the unit in which lengths and coordinates are saved is predefined and cannot be changed. In Allplan, lengths and coordinates are always saved in mm, regardless of which unit was used when the data was entered. To account for different units, use the Resizing factor  parameter. Note : The unit that the destination system uses is always  predefined; it varies depending on the destination system. For conversions to Allplan, for example, data is always saved in mm; for conversions to AutoCAD, the unit is always m. 260 DWG, DXF, DGN interfaces Allplan 2020  Layout scale Select the reference scale with which the file to be converted was created. The layout scale controls text size, text spacing, the size of point symbols, line type definitions and hatching definitions. Note : Depending on the source system and destination system, it is not always possible to change the layout scale. For example, when you export data from Allplan, the current drawing file scale is displayed and cannot be changed. Resizing factor You can use this to enlarge (>1) or reduce (<1) coordinates and length values in the data to be converted. This parameter is always available. For more information, see Resizing factors.  General information on assignments Assignments let you define how properties in the source system are mapped in the target system. For example, you can define the arrangement on layers or the assignment of colors and line types.  Allplan automatically assigns properties in the source system to properties in the target system. If you have activated Allow incomplete assignments  in the Source File for Conversion  dialog box, not all of the properties have to be assigned in order for the transfer to take place. If you want to change an assignment manually, you can do so in the Configuration for Conversion  dialog box. To activate the dialog box, click Modify  in the Import  or Export  dialog box. Properties that are unassigned are marked by an asterisk (*) beside the tab name. Click the tab.  You can quickly see which properties have not been assigned in this tab by activating Show unassigned only .  The assignments can be saved in configuration files. The program ships with standard configuration files for the most important systems. You can also create your own configuration files, however. For more information, see Using configuration files (on page 261). Installation, Basics Exchanging data with other programs 261  Using configuration files Configuration files contain the assignments between elements in the source system and those in the destination system. You can use the standard configuration files that come with the program or create your own configuration files. Standard configuration files The program comes with standard configuration files for the most important systems. The standard configuration files are files tailored to the conversion requirements of the systems involved. They are defined by special names that indicate the direction of conversion and the systems. (For example, the standard configuration file for conversion from Allplan to AutoCAD is nx_ALLFT_AutoCAD.CFG). You can also create your own configuration files.  Using exchange favorites Exchange favorites help you define and apply import and export options. By providing optimum default settings, exchange favorites considerably facilitate data exchange. Allplan 2020 provides favorites for all common data exchanges. An exchange favorite contains special import settings and export settings. You can choose from 9 export favorites and 8 import favorites. Exchange favorites are predefined files (*.nth). Click the About…  button to display a brief description of the currently selected favorite. 262 DWG, DXF, DGN interfaces Allplan 2020  Using prototype files A prototype file  contains specific defaults and resources (for example, layer names, line types). When exporting data, you can find these resources in the Configuration for Conversion  dialog box, where you can make assignments. This can be very useful when the layer names must be returned to AutoCAD as they are. So that the definitions in this file are available, the file must contain at least one element with these properties (pen, line, color, hatching, pattern and so on). You can also use the original file as a prototype file. You have already imported this file to Allplan. Prototype files can only be used for exporting data. Note : Prototype files are not downward compatible. If you want to export data to AutoCAD 2000, use an AutoCAD 2000 prototype file (that is, at least AutoCADV2000.dwg).  Exporting bitmap areas, bitmaps and scanned images Bitmap areas and scanned images are always transferred as complex elements; they cannot be exploded. Bitmap areas and scanned images will be created as .bmp files and must be transferred together with the .dxf/.dwg/.dgn file created. When you reimport the .bmp files into Allplan, they will be imported as bitmap areas. Bitmaps inserted as bitmap links cannot be exported. Note : Bitmap files can be exported to .dgn only when they are exploded, which means that you cannot export scanned images. The following properties of bitmap files are transferred:  • The size and angle of rotation • Information on transparency • The bitmap file itself The following properties are  not transferred:  • The color of transparency and tolerance • The shearing angle • Colors of bitmaps cannot be assigned. The original colors are always used. Installation, Basics Exchanging data with other programs 263  General information on exporting layouts By using the   Export Layouts  tool in Layout Editor , you can export a layout and the documents therein as a DXF/DWG/DGN file. Two options are available: • Explode and transfer layouts : This option unlinks the documents from the layout, writing the data to a single file. Select this option if you want to achieve as identical a layout as possible in AutoCAD. • Transfer layouts as complex elements (not exploded) : This option keeps the link between the documents and the layouts. When you export to AutoCAD model space, the program creates a separate file for the layout itself and for each document placed in the layout. When you export to AutoCAD paper space, the program creates a single file. Select this option if you want to edit the layout in AutoCAD. To define what to do, select or clear the Layouts / XRef files  and XRef to smart sym bol options in the Explode compounds  area on the Advanced Settings  tab of the Settings...  dialog box. The following table shows the most important differences between these two options. 264 DWG, DXF, DGN interfaces Allplan 2020   Explode and export  Export as complex elements  Files created  A single file. If Layouts / XRef Files  is selected: Each document becomes a group. If Convert XRef to smart symbol  is selected: Each document becomes a block. Export to model space: The program creates a main document for the layout and a separate file as an external reference (XRef) for each document. The individual documents are always created as .dwg files. Export to paper space: The program creates a single file; each document becomes a movable viewport. Exploding elements  (in documents) Always exploded Depending on the setting in the Explode elements  area Exploding elements  (in layouts) Depending on the setting in the Explode elements  area Depending on the setting in the Explode elements  area Filtering elements  (in documents)  Print Layouts  tool: Turn off the corresponding options on the Printer  tab in the Selection  area, Elements to print -> Set , and select the Currently visible data  option for export. Depending on the setting in the Transfer elements  area Filtering elements  (in layouts) Depending on the setting in the Transfer elements  area Depending on the setting in the Transfer elements  area Considering clip boundaries  (for example, by layout windows) Yes (regardless of the setting made in Transfer ) If Convert XRef to smart symbol  is selected: If a document is placed several times but with different clip boundaries, it might happen that the document is always placed in a clipped or unclipped state in AutoCAD. Export to model space: No Export to paper space: Yes Paper space – model space  Model space Depending on the setting on the AutoCAD specific  tab Installation, Basics Exchanging data with other programs 265  IFC interface IFC stands for Industry Foundation Classes. IFC define an object-oriented data model for all those involved in the building process. It can be used by all applications that support IFC. It facilitates the accurate exchange of data between these applications. IFC are defined and developed by the IAI. IFC provide an intelligent description of building elements: In addition to the building topology being transferred to the building structure, the IFC interface imports the associated components with all associated data and information (type, geometry, material properties, layout properties and element attributes). The IFC model exported from Allplan supports the intelligent description of Allplan\\'s architectural elements. In addition to the building topology derived from the building structure, the IFC interface exports the associated components including all pieces of data and information (geometry, material properties, layout properties and attributes managed in the Attributes  area). Note : IFC files require a building structure. If the current project does not have a building structure, an IFC-compliant building structure will be created, and the drawing files will be assigned automatically when you import the IFC model. Allplan provides various tools for exchanging data via the IFC interface.  The following tools use a completely new interface as the default. •   importing IFC data  •   Export IFC Data  If your planning partner requests a certified CV2.0 data export , we recommend that you use the tools of the conventional interface: • IFC 2x 3 data; importing  • Export IFC 2x3 Data  Export supports the following file formats: IFC 2x3, IFC XML 2x3, IFC 4, and IFC XML 4. When importing data, you can also select XML and IFC ZIP. 266 IFC interface Allplan 2020  Note : Whenever you import or export data, you get a detailed log including all objects (transferred and not transferred). The log sorts the objects by IFC object type, listing them with their internal IDs.   IFC import (new interface) To use the new interface, select   Import  IFC Data . The new interface imports data in the following formats: IFC 4, IFC XML 4, IFC 2x3, IFC XML 2x3, XML, and IFC ZIP. The new interface offers numerous advantages:  • You can import the IFC 4 and IFC 2x3 formats. IFC ZIP is also possible. • Performance and quality are much better. • Most IFC objects will be imported as corresponding Allplan elements; all the other elements will be imported as user-defined architectural elements. • You can import data to an existing or empty building structure. • You can assign IFC attributes to Allplan attributes. Such a mapping has been possible for export only. • The import log provides more information: Nontransferred elements are sorted by IFC object type and listed with IFC ID. By means of the new interface, you can import IFC data created with almost any system. The new interface imports the following types of geometry:  • Objects created by extrusion • BREPS (surface models) • Surface models • Constructive solid geometries (CSG) • Triangulated geometry • Swept disc solids Installation, Basics Exchanging data with other programs 267  IFC export (new interface) To use the new interface, select   Export IFC Data . The new interface creates data in the following formats: IFC 4, IFC XML 4, IFC 2x3, and IFC XML 2x3. The export log sorts elements that cannot be transferred by problem category and IFC object type, listing the elements with the Name  and Allright_Component_ID  attributes. Note:  The   Export IFC Data  tools considers the visibility settings of layers . If, for example, you want to transfer the load-bearing layer of a wall to IFC, hide the Allplan layers of all other wall layers before you export the data.   IFC BaseQuantities BaseQuantities are dimensions and values calculated from the geometry of the model. You can transfer BaseQuantities with exchange partners. You can transfer IFC BaseQuantities with the following settings:  • Select   Export IFC Data , open the   Settings  and select the Transfer quantities data  option in the Advanced options  area. • The Export IFC 2x3 Data  tool only transfers BaseQuantities if the Certified CV2.0 data export  option is not selected in the Advanced options  area in the   Settings . Note:  IFC Export  considers BaseQuantities of the following components: user-defined architectural elements, openings, windows, doors, railings, columns, roofs, and foundations. Note:  BaseQuantities for areas and volumes of openings will be transferred as positive values. 268 IFC interface Allplan 2020  IFC object type You can use the IFC object type  (IfcObjectType) attribute to change the IFC classification of components. This is particularly important if you cannot find an appropriate Allplan tool to create a component and thus model the component as a 3D object or a user-defined architectural component. Note:  Only use the IFC object type  attribute if you need it. IFC object type  exports the element as a BREP (surface model). Normally, Allplan elements will be assigned automatically to the appropriate IFC classes (walls, columns, ...). If the IFC object type  assigned matches the native Allplan element type, the program ignores the assignment, trying to transfer the element not as a BRep. This prevents loss of quality during IFC export. Note:  IFC export transfers openings in the following components: wall (IfcWall), downstand beam and upstand beam (IfcBeam), column (IfcColumn), slab (IfcSlab), roof (IfcRoof), foundation (IfcFooting), and BuildingElementProxy. If a different IFC object type  is assigned to the component (for example, IfcPlate instead of IfcSlab), openings will not be transferred. Use the   Modify Attributes  tool to assign the IFC object type  (IfcObjectType)  attribute to this component and select the appropriate IFC classification afterward. The most commonly used 21 IFC elements are predefined and can be selected directly in the drop-down list. If you cannot find the required element, click any entry and enter the name of the missing element at the keyboard. The program saves the new entry, presenting it again the next time you select attributes. You can find detailed information on all IFC object types  and IFC object subtypes  in the appendix of the Allplan BIM compendium, which you can download as a PDF file from the Allplan home page (http://www.allplan.com/en). Assigning IFC object type or IFC object subtype Installation, Basics Exchanging data with other programs 269  Importing and exporting PDF data Being independent of provider and operating system, the PDF format supports the flow of information between all those involved in a project. With Adobe technology, you can create data in PDF format straight from Allplan. In addition, you can import PDF files. Import You can import 2D and 3D PDF data to Allplan by selecting Import  in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File  menu.

Often, you want to have the current edit status on paper without having to assemble a layout first. Thus, you can also print details or sections of floor plans.  To create the printout, Allplan uses the settings (for example, margins, header, footer, construction lines) defined in  Print Preview . You can also define the scale and the section of the printout. In addition, you can set up the printer. If you want to print the contents of the active viewport without defining print settings beforehand, select the  Quick Print  tool in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File  menu. The print job will immediately be sent to the printer specified in print preview. If you want to select the printer, click   Print  in the drop-down list of the Allplan icon or on the File  menu. • You create the finished layouts with the tools in the Layout Editor  task. You define the sheet size and scope of the layout and place the layout border and title block. You can use print sets to control what is printed. When printing layouts, you can select the elements to be printed and the output device. 276 Print preview Allplan 2020  Print preview You can use this tool to open print preview. The printout will be an exact match of what you see in print preview. You can define printer settings and margins, select the scale, add headers and footers and specify how the elements look. In addition, you can change the paper size and orientation of the page. This tool works with all printers for which a Windows printer driver is installed and configured. To open and use print preview  1 Click   Print Preview . The Print Preview  palette opens. Everything else closes. 2 Define the settings for print preview in the Settings , Margins  and Display of elements  areas of the Print Preview  palette (on page 277). 3 Use the tools on the viewport toolbar to define the section you want to display. •   Zoom All  or double-clicking with the middle mouse button adjusts all the elements in the loaded drawing files to the maximum printable area of the paper. •   Zoom Section  zooms in on a section. To do this, select and hold the left mouse button and open a selection rectangle around the elements you want to zoom in on. •   Previous View  and   Next View  take you from section to section. • Use   Rotate  to rotate the section 90° counterclockwise click by click. This does not change the scale. • You can move the elements dynamically by selecting and holding the middle mouse button. • Use Scale  to define the display scale. It is identical to the value in the palette. 4 Go to the bar at the bottom of the palette and click Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 277  •   Load favorite  to retrieve (see \"Loading settings for print preview\" on page 280) a file with the settings of the Margins  and Display  of elements  areas. •   Save as a favorite  to save (see \"Saving settings for print preview\" on page 281) the settings in the Margins  and Display of elements  areas to a file. •   Export as PDF  to save the elements in print preview to a PDF file. Define parameters for PDF export in the PDF Export  palette and click Export . Click Close  to return to print preview without creating a PDF file. • Print  to send the elements in print preview to the printer specified. • Click Close  to exit print preview and to return to the workspace. You can also use the Esc key to close print preview.    Print Preview palette You can use the Print Preview  palette to select and set up the printer, define the width of the margins and the width and contents of the header and footer. In addition, you can specify how the elements appear in the printout and make a number of additional settings. You can also save the settings for print preview (see \"Saving settings for print preview\" on page 281) and load the settings you saved (see \"Loading settings for print preview\" on page 280). Note : When you open the palette, the program uses the most recent *.ppv file. Settings  You can select and set up the printer. When you open print preview for first time, the program automatically uses the Windows default printer. 278 Print preview Allplan 2020  Printer  Select the output device in the list box. Click the   Settings  icon to define the properties (for example, paper and color options) of the selected output device or the raster driver specified. Format  Select the paper size in the list box. The program reads the values of the printable area from the driver, displaying them for information. Number of copies  Specify the number of copies. Orientatio n Choose the orientation:   Portrait  or   Landscape . Depending on the orientation you select, the program reads the minimum values for the margins from the driver and corrects the values if this is necessary. To calculate the maximum printable area, the program subtracts the width of the margins and the width of the header and footer from the printable area you define by choosing the Forma t. Margins  Define the width of the margins and the width of the header and footer. You can also drag the margins to the required width. Top, Left, Right, Bottom  Enter the width of the margins. The minimum values depend on the printer. The program automatically corrects these values if this is necessary. Header, Footer  Define the width of the header and footer from the margin.  Reset  With this button, you can reset the margins back to their defaults. The default values of the margins depend on the printer. The default value for the header is 10 mm and that for the footer is 20 mm. Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 279  Display of elements  Define how the elements of print preview look in the final printout and specify the contents of the header and footer. In addition, you can define where the elements are positioned in print preview after you have started it. Scale  Define the scale. You can use any scale. Just click in the box, type in the scale and select the Enter key to confirm. Print construc tion lines  Select the Print construction lines  check box to include elements drawn as construction lines in printouts. Thick line  Select the Thick line  check box to print lines with their actual width. Otherwise, the program uses the same, thin line for all the lines in the printout. Active elements black  Select the Active elements black  check box to print all the elements in active drawing files in black. Otherwise, the colors on the screen match those in printouts (if you use a color printer). Passive ele ments black  Select the Passive elements black  check box to print all the elements in reference drawing files in black (regardless of the setting of the Use same color for elements in reference drawing files  option (  Options  - Desktop environment, Display  page - Drawing file and NDW window  area)). Otherwise, color printers use the color visible on the screen to print elements in reference drawing files. Show margins  Select this check box to display and print a border that indicates the margins and the area for the header and footer. Header and footer  Select this check box to display and print the header and footer. You can define the contents of the header and footer in the Header and footer  palette, which you can open by clicking the Set button. 280 Print preview Allplan 2020  Default position  Specify where you want to display the screen contents in print preview after you have started it. • Lower left  You can see the screen contents in the lower-left area. • Centered  You can see the screen contents in the middle. • Current view  The view in print preview matches that in Allplan. Display when starting  Define the scale for starting print preview. This setting will not apply until you restart print preview. With the As section on the screen  setting, the program selects the scale so that the entire contents of the workspace are visible. The program uses either the width or the height of the workspace.  Loading settings for print preview You can load the settings for print preview from a file in *.ppv format. To load settings for print preview  1 Click   Print Preview . 2 Click   Load  favorite at the bottom of the palette and select the *.ppv file.

Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 281  Saving settings for print preview The program saves the settings for print preview to a file in *.ppv format. When you open the palette, the program uses the most recent *.ppv file. To save print preview settings  1 Click   Print Preview . 2 Specify settings in the Prin t Preview  palette (on page 277). 3 Click Print  or Close  at the bottom of the palette to save the settings to the current *.ppv file. Or: Click   Save as a favorite  and specify the name of the file and the folder. The program saves the settings in the Margins  and Display of elements  areas to the *.ppv file. 282 Assembling and outputting layouts Allplan 2020  Assembling and outputting layouts In Layout Editor , you create a layout from documents and filesets prior to printing. You can create up to 9,999 layouts for each project. When you switch to Layout Editor , you can see the page on which you will assemble the layout and, if activated, the border of the printable area. The exterior boundary of this border defines the paper size of the output device, while the inner boundary defines the maximum printable area (printable area minus device margins). For more information, see Components of a layout (on page 288). You place documents and drawings on the page, which is a white area with a shaded border. You do not place actual documents but a reference to the document or drawing file number. If, for some reason, you move one of these files to a new number after you have assembled the layout and before you send it to the printer, you must replace the original document. As an alternative, you can delete it and place the new document in the layout. You cannot use Layout Editor  to edit data in documents. However, you can place text, dimension lines and primitives in the layout. These elements exist in the layout only; they are not included in the documents. To modify data, switch back to document edit mode. General approach: 1 Select the Layout Editor  task or click   Layout Editor  to switch to Layout Editor . 2 Use   Set Up Page  to specify the format, orientation and the margins of the page. Start with the properties of the page and select the layout border, title block and background. The layout border matches the size of the page. You can specify the distance between the title block and the layout border. When you change the page, the size of the layout border and the position of the title block adapt automatically. Note : As an alternative, you can also place the layout border and title block as discrete layout elements (see steps 3 and 4). In this case, Allplan updates neither the layout border nor the title block to reflect any changes you make to the page orientation or the page format. Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 283  3 If you have not selected the layout border along with the page, place it now by selecting the   Layout  Border  tool. In this case, you can place a layout border of any size on the page. If you want to print the outer boundary of the layout border, position the layout border within the printable area of the page (page format minus margins). 4 If you have not selected the title block along with the page, you can use the   Label  or   Legend, Title Block  tool to label the layout. 5 Use   Layout Element  or   NDW Layout Element  to place documents and filesets within the layout border. 6 Place text, dimension lines and primitives in the layout. (This is optional.) 7 Use   Print Layouts  to print the layout. You can specify the output device, its printable area (printable area minus device margins) and a print profile. 8 If you have not yet created a PDF file of the layout by using   Print Layouts , you can do this now by clicking   Export  PDF Data . Note : Save the label at a reference scale of 1:1.  Printer-independent page format You can specify the page format independently of the printable area of the printer. The advantage of the printer-independent page format is that you can create specific layout formats or special formats even if you do not have a suitable device or driver. Thus, students can create DIN A0 layouts, for example. Due to the separate settings for page and printable area, you must use the   Set Up Page  tool to define the format, orientation and margins of the page. The page represents the area of the layout. You can select a layout border and title block as properties of the page. If you do not assign a background to the page, the page appears as a white area with a shaded border; the margins are light gray. When you make settings for the output device in the   Print Layouts  tool, make sure that you select the printable area so that the page is completely within the printable area. The printout includes the 284 Assembling and outputting layouts Allplan 2020  documents and elements that are within the printable area of the page and output device.  You have two options for defining the margins: • Select Without  margin to output the layout to roll paper or in PDF format. By choosing this option, you automatically change all margins to fixed values of 0.00 mm . With this setting, Allplan always places the page so that its lower-left corner coincides with the lower-left corner of the printable area of the printer selected in the   Print Layouts  tool. This ensures that the printout includes everything as far as the outer border. • Select With  margin to output the layout to a single sheet of paper. Define the margins. If you use Windows drivers for the current layout, you can click the   button to match the device Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 285  margins of the printer selected in the   Print Layouts  tool. This option places the page so that its lower-left corner coincides with the lower-left corner of the single sheet. If you define a layout border together with the page, the device margins might prevent the outer border from being included in the printout.  Note : If the values you enter for the margins are red, these values are smaller than the values the output device can handle. When you close the tool, the program automatically corrects the margins.   Using Windows drivers or Allplan vector drivers You can use Windows drivers or Allplan vector drivers in Layout Editor . If you want to print straight from Print Preview or if you want to use the   Print  tool, you must use Windows drivers. The same applies to layouts with \\'new\\' element types (OLE objects, bitmap areas, fills with gradients and transparency). As the printer manufacturers offer drivers for all current printers and Window drivers can print all elements created in Allplan, we recommend that you generally use Windows drivers. Windows drivers If you use Windows drivers, you can access any printer that has been configured under Windows just as you would from any other Windows program. You can select the output devices straight from Allplan and make printer and document settings. If you want to print complex, large-format layouts, you can use raster drivers for HP DesignJets and compatible printers. As OLE objects, bitmap areas, fills with gradients and transparency are being used increasingly, Windows drivers are becoming more and more important. 286 Allplan raster drivers Allplan 2020  Output channels If you work with Allplan vector drivers, you can use the output channels defined in the Services application. At least one output channel needs to have been defined in the Services  application. Allplan vector drivers are very useful if you want to use old printers for which Windows drivers are no longer available.   Allplan raster drivers Allplan has its own raster drivers for HP DesignJet printers that support Hewlett Packard’s (HP’s) printer language called RTL (Raster Transfer Language) or that use HP\\'s Raster Language Library (RasterLib). These printer drivers are especially useful if you want to print large-format drawings and layouts. Apart from being very reliable, raster drivers speed up printing and produce high-quality printouts. You can only use a raster driver if a Windows printer driver of the same printer type is installed. The HP-RasterLib  driver family optimizes the use of HP\\'s new printer series, enabling you to harness all options provided by the devices. Compared with RTL drivers, HP-RasterLib drivers are more precise. With this driver set, you can specify the level of quality depending on the paper type. Various levels are available for each paper type. In addition, there are a number of advanced options, for example, economy mode. The options that are actually available to you vary depending on the driver selected. Note : Both an RTL driver and a RasterLib driver are available for some devices. Basically, you can use either driver; however, the results can differ due to the color profiles used. Therefore, never switch drivers while you are working on a project. When you have selected a raster driver, the program does not use the Windows printer driver to create output data for the printer. However, the program still uses the Windows printer driver to query the properties of the printer. These include paper size, print resolution, print quality and hardware interfaces. Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 287  Using r aster drivers If you want to use an Allplan raster driver, you must connect this raster driver with a Windows printer driver. Note : You can do this with devices of the same type only. For example, you can connect an HP DesignJet 800 42 Windows driver with the Allplan HP-RTL DesignJet 500/800 or HP-RasterLib DesignJet 800 42 raster driver. However, it would be useless to connect an Epson Stylus Windows driver with the Allplan HP-RTL DesignJet 500/800 raster driver. To use a raster driver  1 In Layout Editor , click   Print Layouts . 2 Select the printer for which you want to use the raster driver in the Settings  area on the Printer  tab. 3 Select the Allplan raster driver  option and choose the raster driver appropriate to the selected printer in the list box. Note : To define the properties of the Allplan raster driver, select the Allplan raster driver  option and then click the   Settings  icon to the left of Printer .  Defining raster driver properties To define the properties of the raster driver  \\uf0dc You have selected the Raster driver  option in the Settings  area on the Printer  tab and chosen the raster driver you want to use. 1 In Layout Editor , click   Print Layouts . 2 Go to the Settings  area on the Printer  tab and click   Settings  to the left of the selected printer. 3 Define the properties for the raster driver on the General  tab and the Colors  tab. 288 Components of a layout Allplan 2020  Components of a layout  Page and printable area  The page represents the area of the layout. The border displays the printable area and the margins of the current output device. The printout includes the documents and elements that are within the printable area of the page and output device. Layout Border  You can choose from several predefined layout borders or define your own ones. Text in layout  You can add text, dimension lines and design entities to layouts. These elements are visible only in the relevant layout.    Documents placed in the layout  Drawing files can be placed individually or as a fileset in layouts. NDW files, however, can only be placed individually. To achieve congruent placements, all you need to do is click in a document you have already placed. Layout size  You can find the height, width and area of the layout border between the outer and inner borders. title block  You can use label styles that adapt automatically to changes. Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 289  Placing portions of a document in a layout There are several ways of placing just sections of a document in a layout rather than the entire document itself. You use the   Layout Window tool. This is usually the easiest approach: • As opposed to layout sections, it is not necessary to create an original layout from which to cut a section to create a new layout. • Additional documents can subsequently be inserted in a layout window. You use detailing windows. Use this option if you want • to display selected elements in the section or in the original, depending on the situation. • to work in document mode in a section. • to use the section to hide parts of the original. You use the tools in the Crop Layout task area to \"cut\" the oversize layout into a number of smaller sections. Use this option if you want • to create layouts in addition to the original one. • the section not to be perpendicular to the layout. • to create a site plan-specific layout border. 290 Sequence in which elements print Allplan 2020  Sequence in which elements print You need to distinguish between the sequence in which elements within a document print and the sequence in which documents and other elements in a layout print. The settings you make for the printer or the Windows driver also affect the sequence. Printing sequence within a document • Sequence in which elements are created or modified: By default, elements are drawn based on the sequence in which they were created or modified. The element you created or modified most recently is always on top, hiding the other elements with the same sequence value. • Display sequence: You can define the display sequence of elements by entering a value between -15 and +16. The elements appear on the screen in accordance with the value set: The greater the value, the further up the element. In other words, the element with the greatest value is on top of all the other elements. If several elements have the same value, the display sequence depends on the sequence in which the elements were created or modified. You can generally place surface elements in the background. New elements are given fixed default values, which you can define in the  Options  - Desktop environment  page - General  area - Sequence defaults  button. You can modify these values. To do this, right-click an element and choose Format Properties  - Sequence  on the shortcut menu. As an alternative, select   Modify Format Properties  - Sequence  in the Change  task area.  Elements from V2003 with the Always on Top  format property get the value +12. • Surface elements (hatching, patterns, fills, bitmap areas, OLE elements, XRefs): You can specify whether surface elements behave like other elements (that is, printing based on creation sequence or display sequence) or whether they are to stay in the background. In the latter case, the creation sequence or display sequence defined controls only the sequence of the surface elements Tip: To bring an element to the top: Move the element and specify the same point for from point  and to point . Allplan then ‘re-creates’ the element, placing it on top of the other elements. Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 291  themselves. Make the following settings if you want to print surface elements in the background so that they are hidden (covered) by design entities: - To print straight from layout editor: Select the   Print Layouts  tool and open the Printer  tab. Go to the Selection  area, click the button beside Elements to print  and select the Surface elements in background of each document  option. - To print with   Print : Open the   Show/Hide  tool and select the Surface elements in background  option. • Scanned images: - To print straight from layout editor: Scanned images always print in the background (within a drawing file). - To print with  Print : Scanned images print in the foreground or background depending on the setting in   Show/Hide . Printing sequence with several documents • Documents are printed in the sequence in which they have been added to the layout. In other words, those placed first are printed first and are hidden (covered) by the documents added later. To place documents with fills and scans in the background, you must place them in the layout first. • When placing drawing files as a fileset: The drawing files print based on their numbers; that is, drawing files with a higher number hide those with a lower number. • You can use the  List Layout Elements  tool to change the document sequence later. Documents that appear at the top of the dialog box hide those below. Printing sequence with documents and other elements in the layout First, the program prints the contents of the documents and then the elements you placed directly in the layout (title blocks, symbols, fills). In other words, these elements placed directly in the layout hide the contents of the documents. To avoid this, you need to save these elements in a separate document. 292 Sequence in which elements print Allplan 2020  Note : Display on the screen and PDF export consider the display sequence of elements. Documents placed get a value of -13, which cannot be changed. Consequently, documents placed in a layout cover elements with a display sequence of -14 and 15, which are placed directly in the layout. The Surface elements in background  and Surface elements in background of each document  options do not affect elements placed directly in layouts. Settings at the printer The settings vary depending on the printer you use (for example, HP, Océ). Please refer to the documentation that came with your printer. To optimize the results, you might have to change the settings several times. Example (HP DesignJet 650C): Pen parameters  - Overlay  Example (HP DesignJet 800): Setup menu  - HP-GL/2 setting  - Overlay  • Off: (default setting): Elements hide one another in accordance with rules 1-3. • On: Elements blend (fills will become mixed colors; lines will be visible in fills). Rules 1-3 do not apply! Example (Océ 9700, Job Director): Data format  - Language -specific settings  - Controller  • Overlay : Elements hide one another in accordance with rules 1-3. • Blend : Elements blend (fills will become mixed colors; lines will be visible in fills). Rules 1-3 do not apply! Settings you can make for the Windows driver Most Windows drivers (for example, for HP DesignJet 650C) automatically deactivate certain printer settings (for example, the Overlay  function). In most cases, you cannot use the driver to control these functions. Use output channels instead. Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 293  Printing color layouts Requirements for printing layouts in color:  • A color-capable printer or large-format printer at which the Color  option (if available) is turned on. • A driver that supports color output (for example, the Allplan vector driver HPCOL_DESIGNJET). • With Windows drivers: Color output is selected in the printer properties (Print Layou ts tool - Printer  tab - Settings  area -   Settings  - for example, Paper/quality  tab). • Print in color  is selected in the More settings  area of the pen and color assignments (Print Layouts  tool - Print profile  tab - Pen and color assignments  option - Set button). On-screen colors and colors in the printout  Whether the on-screen colors match those in the printout depends on the settings for pen and color assignments (Print Layouts  tool - Print prof ile tab - Pen and color assignments  option - Set button). Each color of Allplan\\'s 15 pens or of the 256 basic colors can be assigned a printout color there. If you do not select the Pen and color assignments  option or if you do not redefine colors, the colors on the screen match those in the printout. The color assignments that are actually used depend on the setting of the Color stands for pen  option: • When Color stands for pen  is selected: The element colors are based on the colors that are assigned to Allplan\\'s pens 1 to 15 in the   Options  - Desktop environment - Pen colors  • When Color stands for pen  is not selected: The element colors are based on the colors that were assigned to the elements when they were created or modified. 294 Printing color layouts Allplan 2020  Printing fills and bitmap areas in color  Whether color printers print fills and bitmap areas in color or in shades of gray depends on the setting of the Fills and bitmap areas, grayscale  option on the Print profile  tab in the   Print Layouts  tool. Printing lines, text, dimension text in color  You can specify whether lines (and other 2D design entities such as text or dimension text) print in color, in shades of gray or in black. Select the  Print Layouts  tool, open the Print profile  tab, select the Print and color assignments  check box and click the Set button. In the More settings  area, you can switch between Print in color , Line colors using shades of gray  and Line colors in black . If you have not selected the Fills and bitmap areas , grayscale  option in conjunction with the Line colors, grayscale  or Line colors, black  option, lines appear in shades of gray or black and white and fills appear in color. Select Print in color  to display everything (lines and fills) in color. Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 295  Creating print files Instead of printing your layout, you can create a print file. The data, which is otherwise sent directly to the output device and processed there, is written to a file which can be printed at any time. The print file created can be sent to a printing service or you can print it later by selecting   Print HPGL File . When creating the print file, make sure you have selected the printer on which the file will be printed later. The procedure is different depending on whether you use Windows drivers or Allplan vector drivers. Tip: The   Export HPGL File, Bitmap File  tool provides a comfortable way of creating print files, as you do not need to define printers or output channels for this tool.  PDF files instead of print files Instead of creating print files, you can save layouts as PDF files and print them later. To do this, you can use the   Export PDF Data  tool. You can use this tool to save and archive one or more layouts or the elements in print preview as a PDF file, which you can immediately open with the linked application. Transparency settings and layers from Allplan will be taken into account (unless you use the PDF/A archiving format). Note : You can also use the   Print Preview  tool to output contents of layouts in PDF format. To save layouts or elements in print preview as PDF files  1 Click   Export PDF Data  (Layout Editor  task - Layout Editor  task area). Or: Open   Print Preview  and click   Export as PDF . 296 Creating print files Allplan 2020  2 Only if you have selected this tool in Layout Editor : Select the layouts by using the Layout structure  in the Select layouts  dialog box. Then click OK to confirm. 3 Define settings in the Export PDF Data  dialog box or in the PDF export  palette. Then click OK or Export  respectively.  Notes : • To show or hide layers, which are referred to as levels in PDF files, you need Adobe Reader, which you can download for free from http://www.adobe.de/. Layers that are not visible in the layout will not be transferred as levels to the PDF file. • If you want to export fills with transparency or protect the layout against unauthorized copying, select the Export document as a bitmap  option. However, this produces much more data, which might lead to problems sending or importing PDF files of large layouts. • If you have not selected the Entire layout contents  option in Layout Editor , the size and orientation of the pages in the PDF file will be based on the size and orientation of the current page. The program will create the elements that are within the printable area of the page, ignoring the printable area of the output device. • When you select this tool in Layout Editor , the way the elements look depends on the settings in the   Print Layouts  tool. This means that the look is defined by the elements selected for printing, the page format and the print settings specified on the Print profile  tab. When you select this tool in print preview, the program uses the settings defined in the Print Preview  palette. • When you have selected several layouts in Layout Editor , the file name specified in the PDF file  area will be used for the layout with the lowest layout number. The names for the other PDF files will be assigned automatically. In doing so, the program considers the setting defined for the name of the destination file in the   Options  (Import and export  page - DXF, DWG, PDF export  area). Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 297  - The Use prefix  option has the following effect:   With unnamed layouts and the Use prefix  option being active, the names of all PDF files get the prefix Plan  followed by the number of the layout. Otherwise, the program uses the layout number for the file name.   With named layouts and the Layout or drawing file num ber option being active, the layout name acts as the prefix followed by the number of the layout.   Using print profiles Print profiles are the equivalent of templates in a word-processing program. By assigning a print profile, you ensure that the layouts have a uniform appearance and are in line with office conventions or project conventions. Print profiles are saved as a file with the extension npp. The following settings are saved to a print profile:  • Pen optimization / use pen n for everything • Pen thickness assigned to Allplan pens 1 to 15 • Colors assigned to Allplan basic colors 0 to 255 • Line display • How color printers print fills and bitmap areas • Gamma correction By using the   Print Layouts  tool, the Allplan administrator can create print profiles for the entire office. The program comes with a default configuration (standard.npp), which you can use as the basis. In the Open on a project -specific basis: layouts  dialog box, you can use the shortcut menu to assign a print profile from any path to several selected layouts. When printing layouts, you can select a print profile for every layout or you can choose not to use print profiles at all. This setting is saved with the layout and applies the next time you load the layout. You can temporarily change the settings of the print profile for a 298 Printing in batch mode Allplan 2020  single printout. The next time you load the layout, the settings saved to the print profile will be used again. When printing in batch mode, you can use a fixed print profile for all the layouts or you can use the print profiles saved with the individual layouts. In this case, you can make temporary changes in the print profile of the current layout. Allplan uses the global settings for layouts without print profiles. The print profile you select in the  Export PDF Data  tool has a higher priority rating than the print profiles saved with the layouts; therefore, this print profile is used for all the PDF files that are created in batch mode. Allplan saves the print profile to the favorite file so that you can also use the print profile in   Allplan Exchange Layout Distribution .   Printing in batch mode When you have selected several layouts for printing in the   Print Layouts  tool, these layouts will be printed in batch mode. If a Windows driver is selected for the current layout, you can specify the output device, paper format and print profile you want to use. Thus, you can send some layouts straight to a printer and create print files for the other layouts. If you have selected an Allplan vector driver in the current layout, the program uses this driver to print all the layouts that are part of the batch. Depending on the selected setting, all layouts are sent straight to the printer or several print files are created.  Printing several layouts with Windows drivers (batch mode) As opposed to printing in batch mode with Allplan vector drivers, you can specify the output device, paper format and print profile for the selected layouts when you use Windows drivers. If the defined page format is not available as a paper format for the output device, you can use similar formats. Installation, Basics Layouts and printing 299  Printing in batch mode can be very time-consuming. It is therefore a good idea to check the settings before you start printing so that you can identify and solve potential problems in advance. To print several layouts with Windows drivers  1 Click   Print Layouts  (Layout Editor  task - Layout Editor  task area). 2 Select Windows driver  in the Settings  area on the Printer  tab and choose the output device you want to use. 3 Click the button to the right of Layout  in the Selection  area and use the Layout structure  to select the layouts you want to print to file. 4 Specify the output device, paper format and print profile in the Output multiple times  area. 300 Printing in batch mode Allplan 2020  5 If you want to write all the layouts to a print file and you have not explicitly installed the driver by selecting the FILE  option, select the Print to file  option in the Output mode  area. 6 Select the file type and specify the path where you want to save the print files. (Allplan proposes the folder in the   Options  on the Desktop environment  page - Save/load  area - Folders for saving option; you can accept this folder.) 7 Enter a file name and click Save  to confirm. Allplan uses the specified name plus the start number 0001  for the first unnamed layout. The program creates the names for other unnamed layouts by assigning numbers in ascending order. For example, the name of the print file is Layout . So, the first unnamed layout gets the name Layout0001 ; the other unnamed layouts are then named Layout0002 , Layo ut0003  and so on. If a layout has a name, Allplan uses this name for the name of the print file. 8 Click Start  to confirm the settings and to start printing. 9 You can see the file names proposed for each layout in the Print file  dialog box. To change a file name, click it. The test log tells you which layouts cannot be printed and why. 10 Cancel the operation, solve the problems and start again. When all the layouts have been printed, you can see an output log.

This ensures that the Actionbar always contains new tools. 26 Actionbar Allplan 2020  Actionbar - role, tasks, task areas  The role  is the area where you can find the tasks to be worked on.  The drop-down list contains all the roles that are available to you (both the roles you purchased and the roles you configured yourself). The tasks  that are available to you change with the selected role. To open a task, click the corresponding tab. Each task is subdivided into appropriate task areas . You can find areas in different colors, indicating varying task areas (blue) and fixed task areas (gray). The varying task areas change with the selected task, such as the Components  task area of the Elements  task. You can find the fixed task areas in all roles and tasks, such as the Work Environment  and Filter  task areas. The Quick Access  task area contains tasks with tools used frequently. The first time you open Allplan the task areas are collapsed. To open the flyout menu of the tools, click the downward arrow. You can then see all the tools in the collapsed area.

      "- Node 16: The Actionbar configuration  is the default setting. This configuration consists of the Actionbar  structured by role , task  and task area . The title bar of the Allplan window provides more tools (Allplan icon , Quick Access Toolbar , Bimplus Login  and   Help ). In addition, this configuration comes with the Properties , Wizards , Library , Objects , Planes , Task Board , Connect  and Layers  palettes. Apart from this configuration, the Default Configuration - Classic , Palette Configuration  (see \"Palettes \" on page 33) and Basic Configuration  are also available. To switch to a different configuration, open the View  menu, point to Default Configurations  and select the configuration you want to use.

This illustration shows the Allplan window after you have floated all controls. All that is left is the empty working area (gray area): 20 Title bar Allplan 2020  You have the following options to arrange the Allplan controls in the working area: • You can dock the Actionbar  (on page 24) to the top of the working area. • You can also dock the Palettes  (on page 33) to any edge of the working area. There, you can lock them into position or configure the program to show and hide them automatically. • You can place the Viewports  (on page 67) in the remaining, empty space of the working area. In addition, you can move, arrange and resize them as you like (unless you have maximized a viewport). • You can dock the Dialog line  (on page 88) to the top or bottom of the working area. • The status bar  (on page 89) is always at the bottom of the working area. It is the bottom line of the Allplan window. You can show or hide the status bar, but you cannot float it.   Title bar You can see the current project, fileset, building structure and document in the middle of the title bar of the Allplan window.  You can find the Bimplus Login  on the right side.

If the program finds a tool, you can activate this tool straight from the Find  dialog box. \n",
      "You can configure the Actionbar in Allplan using the **Actionbar Configurator**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Locate the Actionbar Configurator:** You can find the Actionbar Configurator on the right side of the Actionbar.\n",
      "2.  **Open the Actionbar Configuration dialog box:** Click the icon (which is not explicitly described but implied to be a button to open the configurator) to open the Actionbar Configuration dialog box.\n",
      "3.  **Choose to create or modify a role:**\n",
      "    *   Go to the **Configure** tab.\n",
      "    *   To create a new role, click **Create new role**. You can base it on a template (like the roles that come with the program) or start with an **Empty template** to design it yourself.\n",
      "    *   To modify an existing role, select it in the **My roles** area on the Configure tab.\n",
      "4.  **Design the role:**\n",
      "    *   **Move, delete, or add elements** using the drag-and-drop feature.\n",
      "    *   **Change the name of a task or task area** by double-clicking it.\n",
      "    *   **Create flyout menus** by dragging the icon of one tool onto another tool and then releasing the mouse button.\n",
      "5.  **Save the new role:** Allplan automatically saves all roles available in the Actionbar Configurator as a `configuration.actb` file in the `\\Usr\\Local\\Actionbar` folder when the Actionbar Configuration dialog box closes.\n",
      "    *   **Important Note:** If you change roles in the Actionbar Configurator and click the **Save** button, Allplan overwrites the `configuration.actb` file without a prompt. To avoid this, you can save the role in a folder of your choice using the **Export** button on the **Manage roles** tab.\n",
      "6.  **Access the new role:** After saving, you can select the new role from the drop-down list of roles on the left side of the Actionbar.\n",
      "\n",
